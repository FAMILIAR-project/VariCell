Note that dk.itu.fms has been obtained from

https://github.com/mintcoffee/feature-model-synthesis commit 8687d16 (the other part, based on Scala
is not included though). No modification done.

The license is unclear. 

The project is here, but could be integrated into FAMILIAR of course. 

Basic experiments show that the framework is good 
and Andersen et al. SPLC'12 is implemented, especially the efficient support of OR-groups and prime implicants.
