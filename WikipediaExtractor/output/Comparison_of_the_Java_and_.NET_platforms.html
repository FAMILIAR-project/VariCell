          <p> The primary implementation of the Java platform is available as an Open Source implementation called <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a>. </p> 
          <p> While &quot;Java&quot; is an Oracle trademark, and only Oracle can license the name &quot;Java&quot;, numerous free software projects exist that are compatible with Oracle Java. Most notably, <a href="GNU Classpath">GNU Classpath</a> and <a href="GNU Compiler for Java">GCJ</a> provide a free software class library and a compiler that are partially compatible with the current version of Oracle Java.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> <a href="Sun Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>, owner of the Java platform before being acquired by Oracle, announced on November 13, 2006 that all Java source code, excluding <a href="closed-source">closed-source</a> code for which they do not retain rights, will be released under a modified version of the <a href="GNU General Public License">GPL</a>,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> and released two fundamental parts of the <a href="JRE">JRE</a> and <a href="JDK">JDK</a>: <a href="HotSpot">HotSpot</a> and the <a href="javac">javac</a> compiler under the <a href="GNU General Public License">GPL</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
          <p> Following their promise, Sun released the complete <a href="source code">source code</a> of the class library under GPL on May 8, 2007, except some limited parts that were licensed by Sun from 3rd parties who did not want their code to be released under an open-source license<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> (see also <a href="Free Java implementations#After the May 2007 code release">Free Java implementations</a>). Sun's goal was to replace the parts that remain closed with alternative implementations and make the class library completely open. </p> 
          <p> In June 2008, <a href="Red Hat">Red Hat</a> announced<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> that the <a href="IcedTea">IcedTea</a> project has passed the rigorous <a href="Technology Compatibility Kit">Java TCK</a>, indicating a fully functional open-source implementation of the Java platform. </p> 
         </div> 
        </div> 
        <div class="section"> 
         <h4>.NET</h4> 
         <div class="section-body"> 
          <p> Microsoft's .NET <b>CLI executable environment</b> and some of the corresponding class library have been standardized and can be freely implemented without a license. A few standards-compliant free software environments have been implemented, such as the <a href="Mono Project">Mono Project</a> and <a href="DotGNU">DotGNU</a>. The Mono Project has also implemented many of Microsoft's non-standard libraries by examining Microsoft materials, similar to GNU Classpath and Java. </p> 
          <p> Microsoft is currently distributing a <a href="Shared Source Common Language Infrastructure">shared source</a> version of its .NET runtime environment for academic use. However, it is only supported on Windows 7 and has not been updated after .NET 4.0.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
          <p> The Mono project aims to avoid infringing on any patents or copyrights, and to the extent that they are successful, the project can be safely distributed and used under the <a href="GNU General Public License">GPL</a>. On November 2, 2006, Microsoft and Novell announced a joint agreement whereby Microsoft promised not to sue Novell or its customers for patent infringement.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> According to a statement on the blog of Mono project leader <a href="Miguel de Icaza">Miguel de Icaza</a>, this agreement only extends to Mono for Novell developers and users.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Because of the possible threat of Microsoft patents, the <a href="Free Software Foundation">FSF</a> recommends that people avoid creating software that depends on Mono or <a href="C Sharp (programming language)">C#</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
          <p> The Microsoft/Novell agreement was criticized by some in the <a href="open source">open source</a> community because it violates the principles of giving equal rights to all users of a particular program (see <a href="Microsoft-Novell agreement">Agreement with Microsoft</a> and <a href="Mono (software)#Mono and Microsoft's patents">Mono and Microsoft's patents</a>). </p> 
          <p> In response to the Microsoft/Novell agreement, the <a href="Free Software Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a> revised its <a href="GNU General Public License">GNU General Public License</a> to close the loophole used by Microsoft and Novell to bypass the GPL's very restrictive provisions on patent deals.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The FSF also stated that by selling coupons for Novell's Linux software, the mechanism by which Microsoft circumvented the GNU license, it considers Microsoft to be a Linux vendor, and thereby subject to the full terms and conditions laid out in the GPL.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p>

       <h3> Desktop applications </h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> Although Java's <a href="Abstract Window Toolkit">AWT</a> (Abstract Window Toolkit) and <a href="Swing (Java)">Swing</a> libraries are not shy of features, Java has struggled to establish a foothold in the desktop market. <a href="Sun Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a> was also slow, in the eyes of some,<span class="unknown-node">{{Citation needed|...}}</span> to promote Java to developers and end users alike in a way that makes it an appealing choice for desktop software. Even technologies such as <a href="Java Web Start">Java Web Start</a>, which have few parallels within rival languages and platforms, have barely been promoted.<span class="unknown-node">{{Citation needed|...}}</span> </p> 
        <p> The release of Java version 6.0 on December 11, 2006, saw a renewed focus on the desktop market with an extensive set of new tools for closer integration with the desktop. At the 2007 <a href="JavaOne">JavaOne</a> conference Sun made further desktop related announcements, including a new language aimed at taking on <a href="Adobe Flash">Adobe Flash</a> (<a href="JavaFX">JavaFX</a>), a new lightweight way of downloading the JRE that sees the initial footprint reduced to under 2&nbsp;<a href="Megabyte">Mb</a>, and a renewed focus on <a href="multimedia">multimedia</a> libraries. </p> 
        <p> An alternative to AWT and Swing is the <a href="Standard Widget Toolkit">Standard Widget Toolkit</a> (<a href="Standard Widget Toolkit">SWT</a>), which was originally developed by IBM and now maintained by the <a href="Eclipse Foundation">Eclipse Foundation</a>. It attempts to achieve improved performance and visualization of Java desktop applications by relying on underlying native libraries where possible. </p> 
        <p> On Windows, Microsoft's .NET is popular desktop development providing both Windows Forms (a lightweight wrapper around the Win32 API), Windows Presentation Foundation, and Silverlight. With the integration of .NET into the Windows platform, .NET apps are first class citizens in the Windows environment with tighter OS integration and native look and feel compared to Java's Swing. </p> 
        <p> Outside of Windows, Silverlight is portable to the Mac OS X desktop. Mono is also becoming more common in open source and free software systems due to its inclusion<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> on many Linux desktop environments. </p> 
       </div> 
      </div> 
      <div class="section"> 
       <h3> Server applications </h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> This is probably the arena in which the two platforms are closest to being considered rivals. Java, through its <a href="Java EE">Java EE</a> (a.k.a. Java Platform Enterprise Edition) platform, and .NET through <a href="ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a>, compete to create web-based dynamic content and applications. </p> 
        <p> Both platforms are well used and supported in this market, with a bevy of tools and supporting products available for Java EE and .NET. High-end, large-scale, heavy duty solutions tend to opt for Java EE due to higher stability and greater availability of senior developers and also many features such as JMS, JCA, and the ability to run on any Operating System (RISC, CISC, mainframe, etc.) or hardware platform. Some of Oracle's Java-related license agreements for Java EE define aspects of the Java platform as a trade secret,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> and prohibit the end user from contributing to a third-party Java environment. Specifically, at least one current license for an Oracle Java EE development package contains the following terms: <i>&quot;You may make a single archival copy of Software, but otherwise may not copy, modify, or distribute Software.&quot; ? &quot;Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable law, you may not decompile, or reverse engineer Software.&quot; ? &quot;You may not publish or provide the results of any benchmark or comparison tests run on Software to any third party without the prior written consent of Oracle.&quot; ? &quot;Software is confidential and copyrighted.&quot;</i><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> However, while Oracle's software is subject to the above license terms, Oracle's Java EE <a href="API">API</a> reference has been implemented under an open-source license by the <a href="JBoss">JBoss</a> and <a href="JOnAS">JOnAS</a> projects. </p> 
        <p> Microsoft's implementation of <a href="ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> is not part of the standardized CLI, and while Microsoft's runtime environment and development tools are not subject to comparable secrecy agreements to Java EE, the official Microsoft tools are not <a href="open source">open source</a> or <a href="free software">free software</a>, and require Windows servers. However, a <a href="cross-platform">cross-platform</a> free software ASP.NET implementation is part of the <a href="Mono (software)">Mono project</a> (minus webparts and <a href="Web Services Enhancements">Web Services Enhancements</a>).<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Mono supports ASP.NET 4.0 including Web Forms, Microsoft AJAX, and ASP.NET MVC.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> While Mono supports ASP.NET MVC 3 applications, only MVC 2 is currently installed by default because the Razor view engine, while available as open source,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> is not anticipated to be included officially until the 2.12 release.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> Google's popular <a href="Android (operating system)">Android</a> platform for mobile application is based on Java. Google created its own customised virtual machine called Dalvik to optimise the execution of Java code for mobile devices. </p> 
        <p> Oracle provides <a href="Java ME">Java ME</a>; a reference implementation for mobile OEM vendors. Java ME is made up of various profiles that are subsets of the Java desktop environment with additional libraries targeted at mobile and set-top-box development. Java ME has a very large base within the mobile phone and <a href="Personal digital assistant">PDA</a> markets, with only the cheapest devices now devoid of a <a href="K virtual machine">KVM</a> (a cut down <a href="JVM">Java Virtual Machine</a> for use on devices with limited processing power). Java software, including many games, is commonplace. </p> 
        <p> While many feature phones include a JVM, they are not always heavily used by users (particularly in North America)<span class="unknown-node">{{citation needed|...}}</span>. Initially Java applications on most phones typically consisted of menuing systems, small games, or systems to download ringtones etc. However, more powerful phones are increasingly being sold with simple applications pre-loaded, such as translation dictionaries, world clock displays (darkness/light, timezones, etc.) and calculators. Some of these are written in Java, although how often phone owners actually use them is probably unknown. </p> 
        <p> Microsoft currently ships the <a href=".NET Compact Framework">.NET Compact Framework</a> that runs on Windows CE and mobile devices, set-top boxes, and PDAs as well as the <a href="Xbox 360">Xbox 360</a>. Microsoft also provides the <a href=".NET Micro Framework">.NET Micro Framework</a> for embedded developers with limited resources. Alternatively, Novell licenses embeddable versions of Mono to 3rd parties to use in their devices, and <a href="Xamarin">Xamarin</a> commercially distributes the <a href="MonoDroid">MonoDroid</a> and <a href="MonoTouch">MonoTouch</a> framework for Android and iPhone development, respectively. Windows Phone 7 uses Silverlight for native apps, but Windows Phone 8 has C# and XAML as the main languages. </p>

       <h3> Home entertainment technologies </h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> Java has found a market in digital television, where it can be used to provide software that sits alongside programming, or extends the capabilities of a given <a href="Set Top Box">Set Top Box</a>. <a href="TiVo">TiVo</a>, for example, has a facility called &quot;<a href="Home Media Engine">Home Media Engine</a>&quot;, which allows <a href="JavaTV">JavaTV</a> software to be transmitted to an appropriate TiVo device to complement programming or provide extra functionality (for example, personalized stock tickers on a business news program.) </p> 
        <p> A variant of Java has been accepted as the official software tool for use on the next generation optical disc technology <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a>, via the <a href="BD-J">BD-J</a> interactive platform. This will mean that interactive content, such as menus, games, downloadables, etc. on all Blu-ray optical discs will be created under a variant of the Java platform. </p> 
        <p> Rather than using Java, <a href="HD DVD">HD DVD</a> (the defunct high definition successor to <a href="DVD">DVD</a>) used a technology jointly developed by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and <a href="The Walt Disney Company">Disney</a> called <a href="HDi Interactive Format">HDi</a> that was based on <a href="Extensible Markup Language">XML</a>, <a href="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</a>, <a href="JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, and other technologies that are comparable to those used by standard <a href="Web browser">Web browsers</a>. </p> 
        <p> The BD-J platform <a href="Application programming interface">API</a> is more extensive than its iHD rival, with an alleged 8,000 methods and interfaces, as opposed to iHD's 400.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> And while Microsoft is pushing iHD's XML presentation layer by including it with Windows Vista, iHD is still a newcomer in a market sector where Java technologies are already commonplace.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> However, the fact that the HD DVD format has been abandoned in favor of Blu-ray means that HDi is no longer supported on any <a href="optical disc">optical disc</a> format, making the BD-J format a clear winner.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

       <h3> .NET/Mono </h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> On Windows, Microsoft has promoted .NET as its flagship development platform<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> by including the .NET runtime in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and 3, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7. Microsoft also distributes the Visual Studio Express development environment at no cost.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> .NET Framework 3.5 runtime is not pre-installed on versions of Windows prior to Vista SP1, and must be downloaded by the user, which has been criticized because of its large size (65 MB download for .NET 3.5).<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> While neither .NET nor Mono are installed with Mac OS X out-of-the-box, the Mono project can be downloaded and installed separately, for free, for any Mac user who wants to build or run C# and .NET software. As of 13 May 2008, Mono's System.Windows<span class="unknown-node">{{Not a typo|...}}</span>Forms 2.0 is API-complete (contains 100% of classes, methods etc. in Microsoft's System.Windows<span class="unknown-node">{{Not a typo|...}}</span>Forms 2.0); also System.Windows<span class="unknown-node">{{Not a typo|...}}</span>Forms 2.0 works natively on Mac OS X. </p> 
        <p> C# and the CLI are included and used in a number of Linux- and BSD-based operating systems by way of including the free software Mono Project.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> As a result of inclusion of .NET or Mono runtimes in the distributions of Windows and Linux, non-GUI applications that use the programming interfaces that are common to both .NET and Mono can be developed in C# or any other .NET language and then deployed across many operating systems and processor architectures using a runtime environment that is available as a part of the operating system's installation.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Both Microsoft .NET and the Mono project have complete support for the Ecma- and ISO-standardized C# language and .NET runtime, and many of Microsoft's non-standardized .NET programming interfaces have been implemented or are under development in Mono,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> but each environment includes many components that have not been implemented in the other. </p>

        <p> Starting with XP SP1a, Windows does not ship with a Java runtime environment. </p> 
        <p> Java comes pre-installed on all new Apple computers since Mac OS X 10.0. Because Apple maintains the Java runtime for Mac OS X, updates are usually one or two versions behind the versions available from Oracle for the other operating systems, and versions of Java are usually tied to the specific operating system version, so newer Java versions are usually unavailable for older versions of OS X. </p>

        <p> If Java is not installed on a computer by default, it may be downloaded by the user as a Web plugin. The Web plugin process has been criticized because of the size of the Java plugin. Unlike other plugins, the Java download is a full runtime environment capable of running not just applets, but full applications and dynamic WebStart apps. Because of this, the perceived download footprint is larger than some web plugins. However, compared to Java, other popular browser plugins have larger sizes: Java 6 <a href="Java Runtime Environment">JRE</a> is 13 MB, but <a href="Adobe Acrobat">Acrobat Reader</a> is 33 MB, <a href="QuickTime">QuickTime</a> 19 MB, <a href="Windows Media Player">Windows Media Player</a> 25 MB, the <a href=".NET Framework">.NET Framework 3.0</a> runtime is 54 MB, and the .NET Framework 3.5 runtime is 197 MB (it's a united package for x86, x64 and IA-64, each part has approximately 60 MB). </p> 
        <p> At the <a href="JavaOne">JavaOne</a> event in May 2007 Sun announced that the deployment issues with Java would be solved in two major updates during the lifespan of Java 6 (the changes will not be held over to Java 7.) These include: </p> 
        <ul> 
         <li> The introduction of a new consumer JRE edition, with an initial 2&nbsp;Mb footprint and the ability to download the remaining 9&nbsp;Mb in sections using an on-demand methodology.</li> 
         <li> The development of drop-in cross platform <a href="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> code, which can be used from a Web page to install the necessary JRE for a given applet or <a href="Rich Internet Application">Rich Internet Application</a> to run, if necessary.</li> 
         <li> An improvement in support for automatically downloading updates to the JRE.</li> 
         <li> support for pre-loading of the JRE, so applets and applications written in Java start up almost instantaneously.</li> 
        </ul>
