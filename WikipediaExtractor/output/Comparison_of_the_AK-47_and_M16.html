     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> </p> 
      <p> The first assault rifle to see service was created in 1915 by <a href="Vladimir Grigoryevich Fyodorov">Vladimir Fyodorov</a>,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">{{sfn|...}}</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> following the experience gathered in the <a href="Russo-Japanese War">Russo-Japanese War</a>. Several countries had already developed and adopted low-power rifle cartridges since 1890s (such as <a href="6.5&times;52mm Mannlicher-Carcano">6.5&times;52mm Mannlicher-Carcano</a>) as their standard infantry ammunition. The Russo-Japanese war, however, had demonstrated the regular rifles' lack of suppressive firepower,<span class="unknown-node">{{sfn|...}}</span> in addition to the excessive range of their ammunition.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The latter was also confirmed in World War I. The <a href="Fedorov Avtomat">Fyodorov's assault rifle</a> went out of production when the Soviet armed forces decided to standardize its infantry weaponry around only the most popular types of cartridges after the <a href="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a>. The Soviet Union had returned to the development of an assault rifle in 1942 when the need for an intermediate-powered rifle became clearly evident.<span class="unknown-node">{{sfn|...}}</span> By that time <a href="submachine gun">submachine guns</a> were already in widespread use but they could not replace service rifles because of limited power of pistol cartridges. Like the Germans, the Soviets designed an intermediate cartridge that could be made on existing production lines (despite Vladimir Fyodorov's insistence on a special small-calibre cartridge).<span class="unknown-node">{{sfn|...}}</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The work on the weapons for the new ammunition commenced in 1943, with the AK-47 of Mikhail Kalashnikov, the <a href="SKS">SKS-45</a> of <a href="Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov">Sergei Simonov</a> and the <a href="RPD machine gun">RPD</a> of <a href="Vasily Degtyaryov">Vasily Degtyaryov</a> emerging as the victors. </p> 
      <p> The AK-47 was finalized, adopted and entered widespread service in the Soviet army in the early 1950s.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Its firepower, ease of use, low production costs, and reliability were perfectly suited for the Red Army's new mobile warfare doctrines.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The AK-47 was widely supplied or sold to nations allied with the USSR and the blueprints were shared with several friendly nations (the <a href="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> standing out among these with the <a href="Type 56">Type 56</a>).<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> The U.S. Army was influenced by combat experience with semi-automatic weapons such as the <a href="M1 Garand">M1 Garand</a> and <a href="M1 carbine">M1 carbine</a>, which enjoyed a significant advantage over enemies armed primarily with bolt-action rifles.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Although U.S. Army studies of World War II combat accounts had very similar results to that of the Germans and Soviets, the U.S. Army maintained its traditional views and preference for high-powered semi-automatic rifles.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> After World War II, the <a href="United States">United States</a> military started looking for a single automatic rifle to replace the <a href="M1 Garand">M1 Garand</a>, <a href="M1 carbine">M1/M2 Carbines</a>, <a href="M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle">M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle</a>, <a href="M3 submachine gun">M3 &quot;Grease Gun&quot;</a> and <a href="Thompson submachine gun">Thompson submachine gun</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Early experiments with select-fire versions of the M1 Garand proved disappointing.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Also, combat experience suggested that the <a href=".30 Carbine">.30 Carbine</a> round was underpowered.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> American weapons designers reached the same conclusion as the Germans and Soviets: an intermediate round was necessary, and recommended a small caliber, high velocity cartridge.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> However, senior American commanders having faced fanatical enemies and experienced major logistical problems during World War II and the Korean War,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> insisted that a single powerful .30 caliber cartridge be developed, that could not only be used by the new automatic rifle, but by the new <a href="general purpose machine gun">general purpose machine gun</a> (GPMG) in concurrent development.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> This culminated in the development of the <a href="7.62x51 NATO">7.62x51 NATO</a> cartridge and the <a href="M14 rifle">M14 rifle</a><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> which was basically an improved select-fire M1 Garand with a 20 round magazine.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The U.S. also adopted the <a href="M60 machine gun">M60 GPMG</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Its NATO partners adopted the <a href="FN FAL">FN FAL</a> and <a href="HK G3">HK G3</a> rifles, as well as the <a href="FN MAG">FN MAG</a> and <a href="Rheinmetall MG3">Rheinmetall MG3</a> GPMGs. </p> 
      <p> The first confrontations between the AK-47 and the M14 came in the early part of the <a href="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. Battlefield reports indicated that the M14 was uncontrollable in full-auto and that soldiers could not carry enough ammo to maintain fire superiority over the AK-47.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> A replacement was needed: A bridge between the traditional preference for high-powered rifles such as the M14, and the lightweight firepower of the M2 Carbine. </p> 
      <pre>
</pre> 
      <p> As a result, the Army was forced to reconsider a 1957 request by General Willard G. Wyman, commander of the U.S. Continental Army Command (CONARC) to develop a .223 caliber (5.56&nbsp;mm) select-fire rifle weighing 6&nbsp;lbs (2.7&nbsp;kg) when loaded with a 20 round magazine.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The 5.56mm round had to penetrate a standard U.S. <a href="helmet">helmet</a> at 500 yards (460 meters) and retain a velocity in excess of the speed of sound, while matching or exceeding the wounding ability of the .30 Carbine cartridge.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> This request ultimately resulted in the development of a scaled-down version of the <a href="Armalite">Armalite</a> <a href="AR-10">AR-10</a>, called AR-15 rifle.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> However, despite overwhelming evidence that the AR-15 could bring more firepower to bear than the M14, the Army opposed the adoption of the new rifle.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> In January 1963, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara concluded that the AR-15 was the superior weapon system and ordered a halt to M14 production.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> At the time, the AR-15 was the only rifle available that could fulfill the requirement of a universal infantry weapon for issue to all services. After modifications (Most notably: the charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle like AR-10 to the rear of the receiver),<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> the new redesigned rifle was subsequently adopted as the M16.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

       <h3>AK-47</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{Main|...}}</span> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> The AK-47 was designed to be a simple, easy to field strip without tools, reliable automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, using mass production methods that were state of the art in the <a href="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> during the late 1940s. The AK-47's barrel and bolt were milled out of a <a href="Bar stock">steel billet</a> and <a href="hard chromed">hard chromed</a>. Its <a href="receiver (firearms)">receiver</a> was originally designed to be stamped from sheet metal with a milled trunnion insert. However, early production receivers were milled in one piece. In 1959, the sheet metal stamping process was perfected, simplifying manufacture and reducing the weight of the rifle from <span class="unknown-node">{{convert|...}}</span> to <span class="unknown-node">{{convert|...}}</span> without magazine.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The stock was simply made out of wood, which was a non-strategic material, and perfectly fits the Soviet manufacturing philosophy, where large manufacturing plants could manufacture basic weapons in very large quantities. </p> 
        <p> At peak production, <a href="Izhmash">Izhmash</a> can produce around 95 units per hour (about 832,000 units per year).<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Over time, AK-47 descendants have been simplified through the use of spot welding and by further reducing the number of machined parts. Because of its stamped-steel design it is not possible to manufacture the AK-47 series efficiently in small plants, due to the large amount of metal stamping equipment needed for mass production. However, the milled-steel AK-47 has spawned a cottage industry of sorts and has been copied and manufactured (one gun at a time) in small shops around the world.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> As of 2011, Izhmash sells the AK-103 at a government price of $150 to $160 (USD) per unit.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> The World Bank estimates that out of the 500&nbsp;million total firearms available worldwide, 100&nbsp;million are of the Kalashnikov family, and 75&nbsp;million are AK-47s.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

        <p> The AK-47's heavier 7.62x39mm round has superior penetration when compared to the M16's lighter 5.56x45mm round and is better in circumstances where a soldier has to shoot through heavy foliage, walls or a common vehicle's metal body and into an opponent attempting to use these things as cover. The 7.62x39mm M43 projectile does not generally fragment and has an unusual tendency to remain intact even after making contact with bone. The 7.62x39mm round produces significant wounding in cases where the bullet tumbles in tissue,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> but produces relatively minor wounds in cases where the bullet exits before beginning to yaw.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> In the absence of yaw, the M43 round can pencil through tissue with relatively little injury.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> The original ammunition for the M16 was the 5.56x45mm M193 round. When fired from a 20? barrel at ranges of up to 100 meters, the thin-jacketed lead-cored round traveled fast enough (above 2900&nbsp;ft/s) that the force of striking a human body would cause the round to yaw (or tumble) and fragment into about a dozen pieces of various sizes thus created wounds that were out of proportion to its caliber.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> These wounds were much larger than those produced by AK-47 and they were so devastating that many considered the M16 to be an inhumane weapon.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> As the 5.56mm round's velocity decreases, so does the number of fragments that it produces.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The 5.56mm round does not normally fragment at distances beyond 200 meters or at velocities below 2500&nbsp;ft/s, and its lethality become largely dependent on shot placement.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> In March 1970, the U.S. recommended that all <a href="NATO">NATO</a> forces adopt the <a href="5.56x45mm">5.56x45mm</a> cartridge.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> This shift represented a change in the philosophy of the military's long-held position about caliber size. By the middle of the 1970s, other armies were looking at M16-style weapons. A NATO standardization effort soon started and tests of various rounds were carried out starting in 1977.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The U.S. offered the 5.56x45mm M193 round, but there were concerns about its penetration in the face of the wider introduction of <a href="ballistic vest">body armor</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> In the end the Belgian 5.56x45mm SS109 round was chosen (<a href="STANAG">STANAG</a> 4172) in October 1980.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The SS109 round was based on the U.S. cartridge but included a new stronger, heavier, 62 grain bullet design, with better long range performance and improved penetration (specifically, to consistently penetrate the side of a steel helmet at 600 meters).<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Due to its design and lower muzzle velocity (about 3110&nbsp;ft/s)<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> the Belgian SS109 round is considered more humane because it is less likely to fragment than the U.S. M193 round.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The NATO 5.56x45mm standard ammunition produced for U.S. forces is designated <a href="M855">M855</a>. </p> 
        <p> Most, if not all, of the 7.62x39mm ammunition found today is of the upgraded M67 variety. This variety deleted the steel insert, shifting the center of gravity rearward, and allowing the projectile to destabilize (or yaw) at about 3.3&nbsp;inches, nearly 6.7&nbsp;inches earlier in tissue than the M43 round.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> There is now relative parity between the wounding capacity of the M67 and the current M855 5.56x45mm round. However, there have been repeated and consistent reports of the M855's inability to wound effectively (i.e. fragment) when fired from the short barreled M4 carbine (even at close ranges).<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The M4's 14.5&quot; barrel length reduces muzzle velocity to about 2900&nbsp;ft/s.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> This reduced wounding ability is one reason that, despite the Army's transition to short-barrel M4's, the Marine Corps has decided to use the M16A4 with the 20? barrel as the 5.56x45mm M855 is largely dependent upon high velocity in order to wound effectively.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p>

        <p> Both the AK-47 and the M16 will overheat fairly quickly under normal combat conditions and have a sustained rate of fire as low as 12 to 15 rounds per minute (about the same as a bolt-action rifle).<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> <b>Additional firepower</b> </p> 
        <p> All current M16 type rifles are capable of launching NATO STANAG type 22mm <a href="rifle grenade">rifle grenades</a> from their integral flash hiders without the use of an adapter.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> These 22mm rifle grenade types range from powerful anti-tank rounds to simple finned tubes with a fragmentation hand grenade attached to the end.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The &quot;standard&quot; type rifle grenade is propelled by a blank cartridge inserted into the chamber of the rifle. The &quot;bullet trap&quot; and &quot;shoot through&quot; types, as their names imply, use live ammunition. The U.S. military does not generally use rifle grenades,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> however they are used by other nations. </p> 
        <p> Some AK-47 type rifles like the <a href="Zastava M70">Zastava M70s</a> are also capable of launching rifle-grenades and have a grenade-launching ladder-type sight and gas cut-off, attached to the front end of the gas cylinder and coupled to the gas regulator.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> To launch rifle-grenades a 22mm adapter is screwed on in place of the slant brake or other muzzle device.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> All current model M16 and AK-47 rifles can mount under-barrel grenade-launchers such as the <a href="M203 grenade launcher">M203</a>, <a href="M320 grenade launcher">M320</a> and <a href="Heckler &amp; Koch AG36">AG36</a> in the case of the M16, and the <a href="GP-25">GP-25, GP-30 &amp; GP-34</a> for the AK-47. AKM and AKS-74U can also mount the <a href="BS-1 Tishina">BS-1 Tishina</a> and BS-1M Kanareika noiseless grenade launchers (with noiseless discharge) for covert operations. The M16 can also mount under-barrel 12 gauge shotguns such as <a href="KAC Masterkey">KAC Masterkey</a> or the <a href="M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System">M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System</a>. </p> 
        <p> All of these grenades, launchers and shotguns add additional bulk and weight to the soldiers war-load and as a result, they reduce the amount rifle ammunition that soldiers can carry.

       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> With the proper mind-set, training and practice, soldiers armed with both the AK-47 and M16 are quite deadly. The M16's straight-line recoil design, direct impingement gas operation system and smaller caliber gives it less <a href="recoil">recoil</a> than the AK-47 and makes it easier to control in full-auto.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The M16's straight-line recoil design, where the recoil spring is located in the stock directly behind the action,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> and serves the dual function of operating spring and recoil buffer.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The stock being in line with the bore also reduces muzzle rise, especially during automatic fire. Because recoil does not significantly shift the point of aim, faster follow-up shots are possible and user fatigue is reduced. However, the AK-47's heavier weight and slower rate-of-fire do a good job at mitigating any disadvantage. In addition, newer AK-47 type rifles use a <a href="Muzzle brake"> muzzle brake or compensator</a> to reduce recoil.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> And, some AK type rifles also have <a href="Foregrip">vertical foregrips</a> to improve handling characteristics and to counter the effects of <a href="recoil">recoil</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

       <h3>Reliability</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> The AK-47 has always enjoyed a reputation of rugged reliability.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> It is long-stroke <a href="gas operated">gas operated</a>, using the gas from the barrel to push a piston attached to the bolt carrier, thus operating the action. The gas tube is fairly large and is visible above the barrel with ports or vents to allow the excess &quot;dirty&quot; gas to escape without affecting the action. The AK-47 is often built with generous clearances, allowing it to function easily in a dirty environment with little or no maintenance. This makes it reliable but less accurate.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> It is very simple to disassemble and clean, and easy to maintain. </p> 
        <p> The M16 uses a <a href="direct impingement">direct impingement</a> (DI) gas system, similar to normal gas operation in principle, but unique in operation. The gas is sent from the barrel, through the gas tube, directly to the inside of the receiver so it can push on the bolt carrier itself. This means that the gas alone impinges upon the bolt carrier. This design is much lighter and more compact than a gas-piston design. However, this design requires that combustion byproducts from the discharged cartridge be blown into the receiver as well. This quickly accumulating carbon and vaporized metal build-up within the receiver and bolt-carrier negatively affects reliability and necessitates more intensive maintenance on the part of the individual soldier. The DI operation increases the amount of heat that is deposited in the receiver while firing the M16 and causes essential lubricant to be &quot;burned off&quot;. This requires frequent and generous applications of appropriate lubricant.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Lack of proper lubrication is the most common source of weapon stoppages or jams.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> The original M16 fared poorly in the jungles of <a href="Vietnam War">Vietnam</a> and was infamous for reliability problems in the harsh environment. As a result, it became the target of a Congressional investigation.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The investigation found that:<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{quote|...}}</span> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> </p> 
        <p> When these issues were addressed and corrected by the M16A1, the reliability problems decreased greatly.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> According to a February 1968 <a href="United States Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> report, the M16A1 rifle achieved widespread acceptance by U.S. troops in Vietnam. Only 38 of 2100 individuals queried wanted to replace the M16A1 with another weapon. Of those 38, 35 wanted the <a href="CAR-15">CAR-15</a> (a shorter version of the M16) instead.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> In March 1970, the &quot;President?s Blue Ribbon Defense Panel&quot; concluded that the issuance of the M16 saved the lives of 20,000 U.S. servicemen during the Vietnam War, who would have otherwise died had the M14 remained in service.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> However the M16 rifle's reputation continues to suffer.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> After the introduction of the M4 Carbine, it was found that the shorter barrel length of 14.5&nbsp;inches also has a negative effect on reliability, as the gas port is located closer to the chamber than the gas port of the standard length M16 rifle: 7.5&nbsp;inches instead of the 13&nbsp;inches.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> This affects the M4?s timing and increases the amount of stress and heat on the critical components, thereby reducing reliability.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> In a 2002 assessment the USMC found that the M4 malfunctioned three times more often than the M16A4.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Thereafter, the Army and Colt worked to make modifications to the M4 in order to address the problems found.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> In tests conducted in 2005 and 2006 the Army found that on average, the new M4s and M16s fired approximately 5,000 rounds between stoppages.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> The newest version of the M16 in U.S. service is the <a href="HK416">HK416</a><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> which uses a proprietary gas system derived from the <a href="Heckler &amp; Koch G36">HK G36</a>, replacing the <a href="direct impingement">direct impingement</a> gas system used by the standard M16/M4.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The HK system uses a <a href="Gas-operated reloading#Short-stroke piston">short-stroke gas piston</a> driving an operating rod to force the bolt carrier to the rear. This design prevents combustion gases from entering the weapon's interior, a shortcoming with direct impingement systems.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The reduction in heat and fouling of the bolt carrier group increases the reliability of the weapon and extends the interval between stoppages.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The short-stroke gas piston require less maintenance and cleaning.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> It reduces operator cleaning time and stress on critical components.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> &quot;Improving the service interval requirements provides a major benefit to soldiers that may not have the ability or opportunity to thoroughly clean their rifle. Also, the design of the external gas piston system is less susceptible to build up of other contaminants in extreme environments.&quot;<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p>

       <h3>Magazines</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> &quot;Magazines are one of the most important elements of any firearm design. They are responsible for the feeding portion of the cycle of operation. Even in the most proven arm that reliably extracts and ejects, the magazine has to be 100-percent reliable for it to consistently feed properly.&quot;<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> The AK-47?s 30-round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber. Their heavy steel construction combined with &quot;feed-lips&quot; (the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber) machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage. These magazines are so strong that &quot;Soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers, and even bottle openers.&quot;<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> This makes the AK-47 magazine more reliable, although heavier than U.S. and NATO magazines. The early slab-sided steel AK-47 magazines weigh <span class="unknown-node">{{convert|...}}</span> empty.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The later steel AKM magazines had lighter sheet-metal bodies with prominent reinforcing ribs weighing <span class="unknown-node">{{convert|...}}</span> empty.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> There are also light alloy magazines that weight <span class="unknown-node">{{convert|...}}</span> empty but they are sensitive to damage.<span class="unknown-node">{{sfn|...}}</span> The current issue steel-reinforced plastic magazines weight <span class="unknown-node">{{convert|...}}</span> empty.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Early steel AK-47 magazines are 9.75 inches long, and the later ribbed steel AKM and newer plastic magazines are about an inch shorter.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> The M16's magazine was meant to be a lightweight, disposable item.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> As such, it is made of pressed/stamped aluminum and was not designed to be durable.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Therefore, it is easier to damage than an AK-47 magazine and the feed lips are proportionally weaker when compared to the AK-47.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The M16 originally used a straight 20-round magazine which was later replaced by a curved 30-round design.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> As a result, the magazine follower tends to rock or tilt, causing malfunctions.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Many U.S. civilian aftermarket magazines have been developed to effectively mitigate these shortcomings (e.g. Magpul's polymer P-MAG, H&amp;K's all-stainless-steel magazine, etc.).<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> In 2009, the U.S. Military began fielding an &quot;improved magazine&quot; identified by a tan-colored follower.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> &quot;The new follower incorporates an extended rear leg and modified bullet protrusion for improved round stacking and orientation. The self-leveling/anti-tilt follower minimizes jamming while a wider spring coil profile creates even force distribution. The performance gains have not added weight or cost to the magazines.&quot;<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Standard USGI aluminum 30 round M16 magazines weigh <span class="unknown-node">{{convert|...}}</span> empty and are 7.1 inches long.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The newer plastic magazines are about a half inch longer. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> And, the newer steel magazines are about a half inch longer and 4 ounces heavier.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

As a result, the night firing capability of the both the AR-15 and AK-47 were not properly tested. In a subsequent test at Fort Benning an AR-15 equipped with a flash suppressor was tested against both the M14 and the AK-47.
