'''Comparisons between the Great Recession and the Great Depression''' explores the experiences in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]].

On April 17, 2009, head of the IMF [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] said that there was a chance that certain countries may not implement the proper policies to avoid feedback mechanisms that could eventually turn the recession into a depression.  "The free-fall in the global economy may be starting to abate, with a recovery emerging in 2010, but this depends crucially on the right policies being adopted today."  The IMF pointed out that unlike the Great Depression, this recession was synchronized by global integration of markets. Such synchronized recessions were explained to last longer than typical economic downturns and have slower recoveries.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Evans |first=Ambrose |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/5166956/IMF-warns-over-parallels-to-Great-Depression.html |title=IMF warns over parallels to Great Depression |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | location=London}}</ref>

The chief economist of the IMF, Dr. [[Olivier Blanchard]], stated that the percentage of workers laid off for long stints has been rising with each downturn for decades but the figures have surged this time. "Long-term unemployment is alarmingly high: in the US, half the unemployed have been out of work for over six months, something we have not seen since the Great Depression." The IMF also stated that a link between rising inequality within Western economies and deflating demand may exist. The last time that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes was in 1928-1929.<ref>The Telegraph (UK), 2010 Sept. 14, "IMF Fears 'Social Explosion' From World Jobs Crisis: America and Europe face the worst jobs crisis since the 1930s and risk 'an explosion of social unrest' unless they tread carefully, the International Monetary Fund has warned," http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/8000561/IMF-fears-social-explosion-from-world-jobs-crisis.html</ref>

Nobel Prize winning economist [[Paul Krugman]] predicted a series of depressions in his ''[[The Return of Depression Economics]]'' (1999), based on "failures on the demand side of the economy." On January 5, 2009, he wrote that "preventing depressions isn't that easy after all" and that "the economy is still in free fall."<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/opinion/05krugman.html | work=The New York Times | title=Fighting Off Depression | first=Paul | last=Krugman | date=2009-01-05 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}</ref> In March 2009, Krugman explained that a major difference in this situation is that the causes of this financial crisis were from the [[shadow banking system]].

On February 22, 2009, NYU economics professor [[Nouriel Roubini]] said that the crisis was the worst since the Great Depression, and that without cooperation between political parties and foreign countries, and if poor fiscal policy decisions (such as support of [[zombie banks]]) are pursued, the situation "could become as bad as the Great Depression."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=6932460 |title=Roundtable: Nationalizing the Banks - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21}}</ref> On April 27, 2009, Roubini expressed a more upbeat assessment by noting that "the bottom of the economy [will be seen] toward the beginning or middle of next year."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/26/AR2009042601517.html 'I Am Not Dr. Doom'], Washington Post.</ref>

On April 6, 2009 [[Vernon L. Smith]] and Steven Gjerstad offered the hypothesis "that a financial crisis that originates in consumer debt, especially consumer debt concentrated at the low end of the wealth and income distribution, can be transmitted quickly and forcefully into the financial system.

The Austrian School view is that the size of a bust is based, at least in part, on the size of the preceding credit boom. A check of debt levels prior and during the Great Depression shows debt levels prior to the Great Depression at about 200% of GDP, with a rise to about 300% due to massive government intervention to combat the Depression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/10/slouching_toward_the_1930s.html |title=Immediately prior to the Great Depression US debt was about 200% of GDP.

On 10 February 2009, [[Ed Balls]], [[Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]] of the [[United Kingdom]], said that "I think that this is a financial crisis more extreme and more serious than that of the 1930s and we all remember how the politics of that era were shaped by the economy."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7880189.stm |title=UK &#124; UK Politics &#124; Recession 'worst for 100 years' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-02-10 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}</ref>  On 24 January 2009, Edmund Conway, Economics Editor for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', had written that "The plight facing Britain is uncannily similar to the 1930s, since prices of many assets ? from shares to house prices ? are falling at record rates [in Britain], but the value of the debt against which they are held remains unchanged."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Conway |first=Edmund |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/4326894/Britain-on-the-brink-of-an-economic-depression-say-experts.html |title=Britain on the brink of an economic depression, say experts |publisher=Telegraph |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | location=London}}</ref>

On 23 October 2009, it was reported that the British economy had contracted for six successive quarters - the longest run of contraction since quarterly figures were first recorded in 1955.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8321970.stm | work=BBC News | title=Record recession for UK economy | date=2009-10-23}}</ref> The end of the recession was declared on 26 January 2010, when it was reported that the economy had grown by 0.1% in the final quarter of 2009.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8479552.stm | work=BBC News | title=Jobs fear despite recession's end | date=2010-01-26}}</ref>

Fears of a double-dip recession were sparked on 25 January 2011 when it was reported that the economy had contracted by 0.5% during the final quarter of 2010 following a full year of growth, although this was largely blamed on the severe weather which affected the nation in late November and almost all of December.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12272717 | work=BBC News | title=UK economy suffers 0.5% contraction | date=2011-01-25}}</ref> These fears were eased on 27 April 2011 when it was reported that the economy had grown by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2011,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13206430 | work=BBC News | title=UK economy grows by 0.5% in first quarter of 2011 | date=2011-04-27}}</ref> and then on 26 July 2011 when 0.2% growth was reported for the second quarter of the year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14288348 | work=BBC News | title=UK GDP figures show slower growth of 0.2% | date=2011-07-26}}</ref> On 1 November 2011, it was reported that the UK economy had grown by 0.5% during the third quarter of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/gva/gross-domestic-product--preliminary-estimate/q3-2011/stb-q3-2011.html |title=Gross Domestic Product Preliminary Estimate - Q3 2011 |publisher=Ons.gov.uk |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref>
