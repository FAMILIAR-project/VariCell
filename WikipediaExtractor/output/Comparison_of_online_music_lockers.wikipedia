This is a '''comparison of online music storage services''', Internet services that allow uploads of personally owned or licensed music to the [[Cloud storage|cloud]] for listening on multiple devices.<ref>[http://lifehacker.com/5812138/cloud-music-comparison-whats-the-best-service-for-streaming-your-library-everywhere Cloud Music Comparison: What?s the Best Service for Streaming Your Library Everywhere?], [[Lifehacker]], 15 June 2011</ref>

There are currently three large services,<ref>[https://www.pcworld.com/article/244102/google_music_itunes_match_and_amazon_cloud_drive_digital_music_services_comparison.html Google Music, iTunes Match, and Amazon Cloud Drive: Digital Music Services Comparison], [[PC World]], 17 November 2011</ref> each incorporating an [[online music store]] (see [[comparison of online music stores|comparison]]), with purchased songs from the associated music store not counting toward storage limits.  Both Amazon and Apple provided a small amount of storage space at no cost with additional storage for a price.  Other than additional storage space, the main additional feature provided with an annual fee by Amazon and Apple is "scan-and-match", which examines music files on a computer and adds a copy of matched tracks the user's music locker without having to upload the files.  Google provides both a large amount of storage space and the scan-and-match feature at no cost.

While Apple negotiated with the major record labels for a license before launching their service, Amazon and then Google launched their services without obtaining any license from the labels.<ref>[http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/07/are-google-music-and-amazon-cloud-player-illegal/ Unlicensed: Are Google Music and Amazon Cloud Player illegal?], [[Ars Technica]], July 4, 2011</ref>  Amazon and Google eventually negotiated licenses before launching their scan-and-match features.

Unlike other services, Amazon does not allow [[podcast]]s, ringtones, or [[audiobook]]s to be uploaded.<ref name="AmazonImporting">[http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=200593730 Importing Music into Cloud Player], Amazon Help</ref><ref>[http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/01/throwdown-itunes-match-vs-amazon-cloud-player-vs-google-music/2/ Google Music and Amazon Cloud Player take on iTunes Match. Who wins?], [[Ars Technica]], January 17, 2013</ref>

For streaming services where a person is unable to upload their own music, but is limited to music provided by the service, such as [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]] and [[Spotify]], see [[List of online music databases#On-demand streaming music services|On-demand streaming music services]].
