   <h1 class="article-heading">Comparison of Buddhism and Christianity</h1> 
   <div class="article-content"> 
    <p> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> Since the arrival of <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> missionaries in the East in the 13th century, followed by the arrival of <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> in Western Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, similarities were perceived between the practices of Buddhism and Christianity.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> During the 20th century the differences between these two belief systems were also highlighted.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
    <p> Despite surface level non-scholarly analogies, Buddhism and Christianity have inherent and fundamental differences at the deepest levels, beginning with <a href="monotheism">monotheism</a>'s place at the core of Christianity and Buddhism's orientation towards <a href="non-theism">non-theism</a> and its rejection of the notion of a <a href="creator deity">creator deity</a> which runs counter to teachings about <a href="God in Christianity">God in Christianity</a>; and extending to the importance of <a href="Grace in Christianity">Grace in Christianity</a> against the rejection of interference with <a href="Karma">Karma</a> in <a href="Theravada Buddhism">Theravada Buddhism</a>, etc.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
    <p> The central iconic imagery of the two traditions underscore the difference in their belief structure, when the peaceful death of <a href="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> at an old age is contrasted with the harsh image of the <a href="crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion of Jesus</a> as a willing sacrifice for the <a href="Atonement in Christianity">atonement for the sins</a> of humanity.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Buddhists scholars such as <a href="Masao Abe">Masao Abe</a> see the centrality of crucifixion in Christianity as an irreconcilable gap between the two belief systems.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
    <p> Most modern scholarship has roundly rejected any historical basis for the travels of Jesus to India or Tibet or influences between the teachings of Christianity and Buddhism, and has seen the attempts at parallel symbolism as cases of <a href="parallelomania">parallelomania</a> which exaggerate the importance of trifling resemblances.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

     <h2>Initial suggestions of similarity</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{)}}</span> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> Reports of Buddhist practices started to arrive in Western Europe by the 13th century, and were followed by trips by <a href="Christian missionary">Christian missionaries</a> such as <a href="John of Montecorvino">John of Montecorvino</a> and reports began to arrive in the 16th century as missionaries such as St. <a href="Francis Xavier">Francis Xavier</a> arrived in the East.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> In the 19th century, some authors began to perceive similarities between Buddhist and Christian practices, e.g. in 1878 <a href="T.W. Rhys Davids">T.W. Rhys Davids</a> wrote that the earliest missionaries to Tibet observed that similarities have been seen since the first known contact: &quot;<a href="Lamaism">Lamaism</a> with its <a href="lama">shaven priests</a>, its bells and rosaries, its images and <a href="holy water">holy water</a>, its popes and bishops, its abbots and monks of many grades, its processions and feast days, its <a href="confessional">confessional</a> and <a href="purgatory">purgatory</a>, and its worship of the double Virgin, so strongly resembles <a href="Roman Catholicism">Romanism</a> that the first Catholic missionaries thought it must be an imitation by the <a href="devil">devil</a> of the religion of Christ.&quot;<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> In 1880 Ernest De Bunsen made similar observations in that with the exception of the death of Jesus on the cross, and of the Christian doctrine of atonement, the most ancient Buddhist records resemble the traditions recorded in the Gospels about the life and doctrines of Jesus.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> In 1904 William Crooke suggested that Christian <a href="rosary">rosaries</a> had originated in India and arrived in Western Europe during the <a href="Crusade">Crusades</a> via its Muslim version, the <a href="misbaha">tasbih</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> In 1921 <a href="Charles Eliot (diplomat)">Charles Eliot</a>, the British ambassador to Japan also wrote of apparent similarities between Christian practices and their counterparts in Buddhist tradition, and suggested a dependent origin for both traditions.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Early in the 20th century <a href="Burnett Hillman Streeter">Burnett Hillman Streeter</a> suggested that the moral teaching of the Buddha has four resemblances to the Sermon on the Mount.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> Late in the 20th century, historian <a href="Jerry H. Bentley">Jerry H. Bentley</a> also wrote of similarities and stated that it is possible &quot;that Buddhism influenced the early development of Christianity&quot; and suggested &quot;attention to many parallels concerning the births, lives, doctrines, and deaths of the Buddha and Jesus&quot;.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Some high level Buddhists have drawn analogies between Jesus and Buddhism, e.g. in 2001 the <a href="Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a> stated that &quot;Jesus Christ also lived previous lives,&quot; and added that &quot;So, you see, he reached a high state, either as a Bodhisattva, or an enlightened person, through Buddhist practice or something like that&quot;.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

      <p> R.C. Amore refers to a miracle from the first chapter of <i><a href="Mahavagga">Mahavagga</a></i>, the <i>Book of the Discipline, IV</i>, where Buddha himself displayed his power over nature. Amore thinks that Jesus himself was influenced by Buddhist teachings and that Buddhist material continued to influence Christianity as it developed.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> R. Stehly gives six examples of parallel themes between the story of Peter's <a href="Jesus' walk on water">walking on the water</a> and the Buddhist <i><a href="Jataka">Jataka 190</a></i>. </p> 
      <p> The Sinologist <a href="Martin Palmer">Martin Palmer</a> has commented on the similarity between the <a href="Blessed Virgin Mary">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> and <a href="Guan Yin">Guan Yin</a>. Guanyin is the Chinese name for a male bodhisattva in India and Tibet, <a href="Avalokitesvara">Avalokitesvara</a>, who underwent a gradual feminization process in China late in the first millennium CE, after a period of <a href="proselytization">proselytization</a> by <a href="Turkic people">Turkic</a> <a href="Nestorian Christian">Nestorian Christians</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The <a href="Tzu-Chi">Tzu-Chi</a> Foundation, a Taiwanese Buddhist organization, also noticing the similarity, commissioned a portrait of Guan Yin and a baby that resembles the typical <a href="Madonna and Child">Madonna and Child</a> painting. </p> 
      <p> Z. P. Thundy has surveyed the similarities and differences between the birth stories of Buddha by <a href="Maya (mother of Buddha)">Maya</a> and Jesus by Mary and notes that while there are similarities such as virgin birth, there are also differences, e.g. that Mary outlives Jesus after raising him, but Maya dies soon after the birth of Buddha, as all mothers of Buddhas do in the Buddhist tradition.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Thundy does not assert that there is any historical evidence that the Christian birth stories of Jesus were derived from the Buddhist traditions, but suggests that as an avenue for further research.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

    <div class="section"> 
     <h2>Irreconcilable foundations</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{)}}</span> There are inherent and fundamental differences between Buddhism and Christianity, one significant element being that while Christianity is at its core <a href="monotheistic">monotheistic</a> and relies on a <a href="God in Christianity">God as a Creator</a>, Buddhism is generally <a href="non-theistic">non-theistic</a> and rejects the notion of a Creator God which provides divine values for the world.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> The <a href="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a>, the most widely used <a href="Christian creed">Christian creed</a>, states that &quot;We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible&quot;.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> However, the notion of theistic creation is generally foreign to Buddhist thought, and the question of the existence of God is perhaps one the most fundamental barrier between the teachings of Christianity and Buddhism.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Although <a href="Mahayana Buddhism">Mahayana Buddhism</a> expresses belief in <a href="Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a> this is very different from the notion of Creator God in Christianity.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> While some variations of Buddhism believe in an impersonal <a href="eternal Buddha">eternal Buddha</a> or <a href="trikaya">creative force</a>, in general Buddhism sees the universe as eternal and without a starting point of creation.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> There are inherent differences in the Christian and Buddhist beliefs regarding the <a href="End Times">End Times</a> and <a href="eschatology">eschatology</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Jan Nattier states that while Buddhism has a notion of &quot;relative eschatology&quot; that refers to specific cycles of life, the term &quot;Buddhist eschatology&quot; does not relate to any &quot;final things&quot;, or that the world will end one day - Buddhist scripture routinely referring to the &quot;biginningless <a href="Sa?s?ra">Sa?s?ra</a>&quot; as a never ending cycle of birth and death with no starting point.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> However, Christian eschatology directly involves the concept of &quot;end to all creation&quot; at the <a href="Last Judgement">Last Judgement</a> when the world will reach its conclusion.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Scholars generally regard the Buddhist and Christian views of the End Times as incompatible.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> There are other fundamental differences, e.g. while <a href="Grace in Christianity">Grace in Christianity</a> is part of the very fabric of theology, in <a href="Theravada Buddhism">Theravada Buddhism</a> no deity can interfere with <a href="Karma">Karma</a> and hence the notion of any type of grace is inadmissible within these teachings.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> <a href="Mahayana Buddhism">Mahayana Buddhism</a> however, differs on this issue.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> The <a href="crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion of Jesus</a> as a single event in history that acts for the atonement of sins is a central element of Christian belief.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> This, however, produces a strong difference between Christian and Buddhist teachings.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Buddhist scholar <a href="Masao Abe">Masao Abe</a> pointed out that while &quot;the event of the Cross&quot; is central to Christianity, it is not possible for Buddhism to accept its importance.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Buddhist philosopher <a href="D. T. Suzuki">D. T. Suzuki</a> stated that every time he saw a crucifixion scene it reminded him of the &quot;gap that lies deep&quot; between Christianity and Buddhism.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> This inherent difference in the belief systems is also reflected on the iconic imagery of the two traditions.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The depiction of the harsh crucifixion of Jesus as a willing sacrifice for the atonement for the sins of humanity is central to Christian iconography, and is totally different from the peaceful death of an eighty-year-old <a href="Gautama Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> lying between two trees as he accepts final <a href="Nirvana">Nirvana</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> Moreover, modern scholarship has generally rejected suggestions of an influence from Buddhism on Christianity is fanciful and without any historical basis.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> <a href="Paula Fredriksen">Paula Fredriksen</a> states that no serious scholarly work places Jesus outside the backdrop of 1st-century Palestinian Judaism.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>
