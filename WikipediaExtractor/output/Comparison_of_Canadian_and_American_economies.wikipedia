The '''economies of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]''' are similar because they are both [[developed countries]] and are each other's largest trading partners. However, key differences in population makeup, geography, government policies and productivity all result in different economies.

==Government==

===Taxation===
{{main|Taxation in Canada|Taxation in the United States}}{{Disputed section|date=August 2012}}
[[Image:Series2004NoteFront 50.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The American 50 Dollar Bill]]
In Canada total tax and [[non-tax revenue]] for every level of government equals about 38.4% of GDP,<ref name="caf">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/canada|title=Index of Economic Freedom 2009: Canada|year=2009}}</ref> compared to the U.S. rate of 28.2%.<ref name=usf>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/UnitedStates|title=Index of Economic Freedom 2009: United States|year=2009}}</ref>

A significant portion of this tax differential is due to spending differences between the two countries.  While the US is running deficits of about 4% of GDP,<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.cbpp.org/1-15-04bud.htm Total Revenues From All Levels Of Government Drop To Lowest Share Of Economy Since 1968, 1/15/04<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Canada's Federal government posted a budget surplus of around 1% of GDP per year from the mid-1990s until 2008, and is projected to enter back into a surplus by 2016.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/budget/ | work=CBC News | title=CBC News Indepth: Budget}}</ref>  The deficit patterns and indebtedness of Canada's individual provinces vary like they do in the US among different states. Considered in a revenue-neutral context, the differential is much smaller - Canada's total governmental spending was about 36% of GDP<ref>[http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/govt48b.htm Consolidated government revenue and expenditures<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> vs. 31% in the US.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In addition, caution must be used when comparing taxes across countries, due to the different services each offers. Whereas the Canadian healthcare system is 70% government-funded, the US system is just under 50% government-funded (mostly via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]]); adding the additional healthcare-spending burden to the above figures to obtain comparable numbers (+3% for Canada, +7% for the US) gives adjusted expenditures of 38?39% of GDP for each of the two nations.

The taxes are applied the same as well. Canada's income tax system is more heavily biased against the highest income earners, thus while Canada's income tax rate is higher on average{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}, the bottom fifty percent of the population is roughly taxed the same on income as in the United States. However, Canada has a national [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|goods and services tax]] of 5% on most purchases, while the U.S. federal government does not, increasing the tax burden on Canadian low-income earners due to the [[Proportional tax|proportional]] nature of a sales tax.  Canadian GST does not tax food and other essentials and a GST rebate for low-income earners mitigates regressiveness.<ref>Fellows, C. Michael et al. Economic Issues: A Canadian Perspective. (Toronto: McGraw-Hill Ryerson, 1997) 217.</ref>

In addition to the 5% GST levied on most purchases, some Canadians also pay a provincial sales tax at a rate that varies by province and can be as high as 10%. In Ontario, for example, where the provincial sales tax (PST) is 8%, consumers must pay a total of 13% sales tax on top of the purchase price.  (It should be noted that Ontario has eliminated both the PST and GST, replacing them with harmonized sales tax, or HST, of 13%, which changes the sales tax on some items.) There are some purchases which are PST exempt, such as children's clothing. In the U.S., most states impose a sales tax, and cities and counties are often permitted to levy taxes as well, which can exceed 10% on purchases but realistically average at about 6-8%. Five U.S. states do not have any sales tax imposed.<ref>http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/sales.pdf</ref> The Canadian province of Alberta and all three territories have no provincial or territorial sales tax on top of the GST.

===Government Spending===
Government spending at all levels (federal, state/provincial and local) has traditionally been higher in Canada than the United States. In Canada, government spending as a percentage of [[GDP]] peaked at 53% in 1992. Since 1992 spending has steadily declined in Canada to just below 40 percent in 2008.<ref>[http://www.fraserinstitute.org/Commerce.web/product_files/ReducingtheSizeofGovernment.pdf Reducing the size of government]</ref>

Spending in the United States fluctuated narrowly around 34-38 percent of GDP over the same period.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/pages/canada/index.html Great Right North]</ref>  However, starting in 2008 US spending has turned sharply upwards to reach an estimated 42.7% of GDP in 2009{{Update after|2012|9|5}}
<ref>[http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/year2009_0.html#usgs302 Government Spending Details]</ref> from 39% in 2008. Spending is expected to reach 45% of GDP in 2011
{{Update after|2012|9|5}},<ref>[http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/year2011_0.html#usgs302 Government Spending Details]</ref> and stabilize at that level.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Social programs===
{{See also|Canadian and American health care systems compared}}

For its higher taxes Canada has a larger system of [[social program]]s than the United States. This includes having a national broadcaster in the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], a largely government-funded [[health care]] system, and having all major [[universities]] receive partial government funding. The United States, however, does have most of its major universities subsidized by [[U.S. state|state]] government. The US also has two national public broadcasters which receive partial government funding, [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] (television) and [[National Public Radio|NPR]] (radio).

The greatest difference in social programs is in health care. Contrary to popular belief, the U.S. Government spends as much on health care, 7% of GDP, as the Canadian government does,<ref>Rising Health Costs U.S. health care: expensive and less effective at keeping people healthy<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> and total healthcare spending is much higher - 14.6% of GDP in the US vs. 10% in Canada.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/priceofcare.html | work=CBC News | title=CBC News Indepth: Health Care}}</ref> Canadians, however, receive comparable care to those Americans who receive treatment, and result measures. The Canadian health care system is said by some also to be attractive to employers, as in Canada health care is mostly paid through employee income taxes, while in the United States most companies choose to extend [[Health benefits (insurance)|health benefits]] to full-time employees. Many employers in Canada do offer employees some additional medical coverage, for non-necessary treatments, and for pharmaceuticals which are not universally covered by the government-paid health insurance system. The most common complaint regarding the Canadian system are the long lines and waiting periods that have appeared for minor and non-life threatening procedures over the last 15 years, since the introduction of widespread cuts to public funding. Separately, a number of medical tests and screenings are not covered (or due to increasing costs, are no longer covered) by the Canadian health system, forcing patients to pay for these services out of their own pockets. For these reasons, some relatively wealthy Canadians undergo treatment at private healthcare facilities at their own expense, either in Canada, in India, or in other nations<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/medicaltourism.html | work=CBC News | title=CBC News Indepth: HEALTH CARE}}</ref> to avoid waiting for medical treatment, joining "[[medical tourism|medical tourists]]" from many nations, including the US.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Despite these sporadic problems, Canada's healthcare performance is generally on par with the US.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Efforts were made to reduce wait times by many provincial governments in the 1990s and 2000s, in an effort to improve care. Furthermore, healthcare coverage is universal for Canadians, and transferable outside a home province within Canada.

===Anti-trust===
{{main|Canadian competition law|United States antitrust law}}

The United States has since the [[Sherman Anti-Trust Act]] been strongly opposed to [[monopolies]]. In Canada this has been far less of an issue, and Canada has never had rigorously enforced rules against monopolization, and in certain situations the government has even encouraged monopolies. However, the Canadian government is more willing to interfere in the operations of large, integrated firms where they appear to be acting against the public interest, offsetting in part one reason that American law prevents large-scale monopolization. Historical transport policy led to the promotion of one railway operator & one dominant flag carrier and the promotion of bus carriers through the suppression of other bus-like services. In telecommunications policy, oligopoly conditions are reinforced through the actions of the Canada Radio and Telecommunications (CRTC). Foreign ownership has been banned in Canada's cell phone market (Though one Egyptian-owned entrant, Windmobile has led to a possibility of a liberalization of telecommunications) Banking policy has been regulated through Bank Acts passed by Parliament.

===Fiscal and monetary policy===
{{see also|Fiscal policy of the United States|Monetary policy of the United States}}
Canada is generally forced to follow American [[monetary policy]] quite closely, any large difference in [[interest rate]]s could quickly lead to large problems for the Canadian economy. The U.S. [[Federal Reserve]] and the [[Bank of Canada]] both staunchly believe in fighting [[inflation]] while neither aggressively pursue policies of [[full employment]]. One difference that has emerged recently is that while Canada is still hewing closely to the [[budget|balanced budget]]s policies of the 1990s the United States has moved into a heavy [[Government budget deficit|deficit]], a policy both countries followed in the 1970s and 1980s.

==Market size==
One of the most important differences historically between Canada and the United States was the size of the two markets. When both nations had high tariffs the two countries did not have a unified market. Canada's smaller market led to higher prices and greater inefficiency.

A good example of this is the automobile industry, which can be clearly demarcated into two periods: before and after the free trade creating [[Auto Pact]] of 1969. Before this, Canada had its own production lines creating each of the models that would be sold in Canada. These [[branch plant]] factories would only make small production runs of each vehicle, requiring frequent, and expensive retoolings. The factories would also generally be smaller. Fewer varieties were available to Canadian consumers and prices were generally higher. However, these cars were almost all still made by American companies. After the Auto Pact, the industry was transformed as a unified North American market was created. The Canadian factories were rebuilt to be much larger, but to make only one model that would be sold in both countries creating large [[economies of scale]]. The prices of cars fell in Canada as wages and total employment in the automobile sector increased.

After the [[Second World War]] tariffs between the two countries gradually fell, with full [[free trade]] being established by the 1988 [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]]. Some industries are still protected, however. These are mostly perceived as sensitive areas such as cultural industries including publishing, television, and newspapers, all of which have stringent foreign ownership rules. Other areas such as the transport industry are also protected with Canadian control of the airlines and trains being viewed as in the national interest.

This tends to create far more monopolies in Canada. For instance the air travel industry in Canada until recently was dominated by a single airline, [[Air Canada]]. Canada has long had to make a trade-off between monopolization and efficiency which the United States has not. The United States can support a number of airlines that are big enough to operate efficiently, and still have a competitive market (although in recent years the competitiveness of the major US airlines declined sharply). Canadians are forced to choose between small inefficient airlines that would be competitive, or monopolistic airlines that will generate their own inefficiency.

==Banking==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
{{Out of date|section|date=October 2010}}
[[Banking in Canada|Canada]] and the [[Banking in the United States|United States]] have long had very different [[Bank|banking]] systems. The United States' was copied from [[England]], while Canada's was taken from [[Scotland]]. The United States traditionally has had a plethora of banks, some with very few branches. The U.S. system continues to support the creation of numerous small banks through both government-sponsored institutions like the [[Federal Home Loan Banks]] and similar non-government entities like [[Bankers' bank]], that does not exist in markets like Canada.  This has led to a more competitive but less stable system, with many thousands of banks having collapsed during [[History of banking in the United States|U.S. history]]. The [[Glass?Steagall Act]] and other laws and regulations prevented U.S. banks from growing beyond certain limits. Changes allowed U.S. banks to grow and the [[Glass?Steagall Act]] was repealed in 1999. Canada has always had far fewer banks per capita, but the banks have been larger and quickly expanded nationwide. [[Big Five (banks)|Canadian banks]] have many branches and distributed assets. Canada has only had one major bank, the [[Home Bank]], collapse in its history. This concentration of banks in Canada relative to the U.S. has continued to this day. In 2002, Canada's the six largest banks controlled 90 percent of Canadian domestic banking assets, while the five largest U.S. banks controlled only 9.7 percent of their domestic assets.

There are several subsidies in the U.S. system that do not exist in Canada.  In terms of direct impact to consumers, mortgage interest is a tax deductible in the U.S. (a [[market distortion]] designed to encourage home ownership), but is not in Canada.  The U.S. also indirectly subsidizes mortgages through a plethora of [[government sponsored enterprise]]s.  The U.S. entities do much more than provide [[mortgage insurance]], and use their own huge balance sheets to purchase mortgages.  The [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] historically was mainly limited to providing mortgage insurance, although now facilitates funding of mortgages also through the [[Canada Mortgage Bond]] program, which has also grown to be quite large.

[[Big Five (banks)|Canada's banks]] have traditionally been fierce competitors internationally, while America's largest banks have had a more significant presence overseas. In part, the history of this situation is rooted in Canada's smaller market. For Canadian banks, international exchange was always a central concern. For American banks, domestic banking was paramount. In the 1920s, Canadian banks dominated the international banking sector due to greater expertise and focus in the American economic centre of [[New York]]. Thus Canadian banks came to have a wider spread networks. Much of the banking system in the [[West Indies]] is controlled by the Canadian banks. Canadian banks also have far more of a presence in the United States than American firms do in Canada. In part, this is because American firms cannot buy Canadian banks, but Canadian banks have, at times, been able to buy American ones. Since the large Canadian banks already operated nationwide chains of a thousand or more branches, they find it relatively easy to integrate smaller chains of American banks into their systems.

In recent years this advantage has disappeared as American banks have also grown substantially in size and today have many branches, and the large American banks are now operating over 2000 branches each. In fact, the ten largest banks in North America today are all U.S.-based. Overseas, American banks have a larger presence than Canadian banks. Only [[Royal Bank of Canada]]'s [[RBC Capital Markets]] division has a global scale that even approaches that of the U.S. investment banks.

Until recently, Canadian banks had historically been far less strictly regulated than their American counterparts. Canadian banks had, until the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] in 1999, been freer to participate in the financial planning and insurance industries than their American counterparts. In the 1980s and 1990s, the large Canadian banks acquired almost all significant trust and brokerage companies in Canada. They also started their own mutual fund and insurance businesses. As a result, Canadian banks broadened out to become supermarkets of financial services, a trend that started later in the U.S. market. The average U.S. bank is a domestic banking operation. The large Canadian banks are financial conglomerates, with large domestic Canadian banking operations.

Bank regulation in the United States is highly fragmented compared to Canada which has only [[OSFI]] as the bank regulator (although [[credit unions]] are provincially regulated). In the U.S., a bank's primary regulator could be the [[Federal Reserve Board]], the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]], the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]], or any one of 50 state regulatory bodies, depending on the charter of the bank. And within the Federal Reserve Board, there are 12 districts with 12 different regulatory staffing groups. The U.S. is also one of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not safety and soundness related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-[[usury]] lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments. Even individual cities enact their own financial regulation laws (for example, for [[usury]] lending). Canadian banks have not faced laws against [[usury]], or interest guarantees on deposits. [[Return on equity]] for Canadian banks were generally comparable to U.S. banks (with [[return on assets]] lower, but with Canadian banks using more leverage to compensate).

Credit unions in Canada are tax-paying entities, while they have been tax-exempt in the U.S.  However, as restrictions on the size of credit unions in the U.S. have eased, the [[American Bankers Association]] has lobbied to have credit unions taxed to level the playing field.

==Prices==
In Canada prices have long tended to be higher. This is partly because of structural issues in Canada such as low population density{{Dubious|date=January 2012}} and harsher weather{{Dubious|date=January 2012}}, and partly due to Canada's tax system, which depends more heavily on sales taxes relative to income taxes than the US. This has contributed to phenomena such as [[cross-border shopping]]. Since the early 1990s this has not been the case{{Whom?|date=January 2012}}, as the [[Canadian dollar]] had fallen low enough{{Vague|date=January 2012}} that it more than made up for price differences{{Dubious|date=January 2012}}. Today prices are somewhat lower in Canada for at least one item: the [[Big Mac Index]] shows that in January 2006 a [[Big Mac]] cost $3.15 in the States and only $3.01 in Canada [http://www.economist.com/markets/bigmac/displayStory.cfm?story_id=5389856] (both figures in [[USD]]).  In October, 2007 a strong Canadian dollar rose to parity with a weak American dollar, benefiting Canadian travelers and consumers. However, this was not favorable to  Canadian manufacturers and exporters who do most of their business south of the border. As the economic conditions decayed in 2008, a flight to safety in the American dollar and lower prices{{Quantify|date=January 2012}} for Canadian commodities{{Which|date=January 2012}} reversed some of the growth in the Canadian dollar relative to the American dollar.

[[Fuel]] prices have always been higher in Canada, even though Canada is a net exporter of energy. This is because Canada, unlike many oil producers, does not heavily subsidize fuel.  Prices are based on the world market price.

==Productivity==
Canadian workers are estimated to be 82% as productive per hour as their American counterparts.<ref>[http://ideas.repec.org/a/sls/ipmsls/v9y20041.html Measuring the Canada-U.S. Productivity Gap: Industry Dimensions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The industries with the largest productivity advantages for the U.S. are the [[manufacturing]] (particularly [[electronics]] and [[computer]]), [[finance]], and [[Service Sector|service]] sectors. Industries where Canada is more productive than the U.S. are the [[construction]] and [[natural resources]] sectors with Canadian workers achieving 129% relative productivity.<ref>[http://ideas.repec.org/a/sls/ipmsls/v9y20041.html Measuring the Canada-U.S. Productivity Gap: Industry Dimensions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The productivity gap had been even larger in the 1950s but the difference has been narrowing, aided by the elimination of the smaller market problem through free trade. The gap was still closing somewhat in the 1980s but at a much slower pace than in the 1960s. From 1961 to 1973 labour productivity rose annually by 3.3 percent in Canada and 1.7 percent in the United States. From 1973 to 1995 productivity growth was 1.1% in Canada and 0.8% in the United States.<ref>http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1997/12/pdf/salgado.pdf</ref>

The productivity gap began to widen again in the 1990s, particularly in the manufacturing sector. By 2000, this was called Canada's "Excellence Gap" by the Chief Economist of Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters.<ref>[http://www.cme-mec.ca/national/documents/Excellence_Gap.pdf Microsoft Word - Excellence Gap.DOC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The United States has the second-highest productivity of the [[G8]] countries,<ref>[http://users.aber.ac.uk/sbj5/economy.htm New Page 2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> while Canada's is 5th based on the 1997 estimate.<ref>http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/pics/pr/livstand.pdf</ref>

Five main reasons for the productivity gap: the lower capital intensity of economic activity in Canada; an innovation gap in Canada relative to the United States; Canada's relatively underdeveloped high-tech sector; less developed human capital in Canada in terms of proportionately fewer university graduates and scientists and engineers in research and development; and more limited economies of scale and scope in Canada.

==Organized Labour==
Both Canada and the U.S. follow the [[National Labor Relations Act|Wagoner Act]] model of regulating trade unions and collective bargaining, though legislation regulating organized labor principally falls under provincial jurisdiction in Canada.  That North American model differs significantly from patterns of organized labor found in other developed countries.

==Unemployment==
For several decades Canada typically had reported its [[unemployment rate]] as somewhat higher than the US rate. For example, in June 2008 the reported unemployment in the US was 5.5 percent and 6.1% in Canada. However, a closer examination reveals that the two countries measure the unemployment rate differently. [[Craig Riddell]], a [[University of British Columbia]] economist, found that a 0.9% difference was caused by the differing measurement systems.<ref>[http://www.econ.ubc.ca/riddell/canusune.pdf Microsoft Word - Can-US unem 2003.doc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Statistics Canada has also acknowledged this, and it now publishes a second unemployment rate using the same methodology as the Americans. Using the American methodology, the June 2008 Canadian unemployment rate was 5.3%, which was 0.2% lower than the American rate.<ref>Scoffield, Heather. "Unemployment levels fall below U.S. rate" ''The Globe and Mail.'' June 6, 2008</ref>

Prior to the identification of the difference in methodologies, some politicians claimed that higher income taxes, restrictive labour laws, unions, universal healthcare, and greater unemployment benefits in Canada were causing a higher ''actual'' unemployment rate.  However, when [[unemployment insurance]] and [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] were sharply cut in many parts of Canada during the 1990s there was little gain in employment relative to the Americans.  Others attempted to explain the reported difference in terms of the large number of [[seasonal worker]]s in trades such as [[fishing]] and [[logging]] who are unemployed for a portion of the year.

==Balance of trade==
While the United States has in recent years had a large [[trade deficit]], Canada had for several decades maintained a [[trade surplus]], which turned to a deficit since 2006.<ref>[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/65-001-x/2011003/t004-eng.htm Merchandise trade of Canada, balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted ? Constant dollars, 2002]</ref> The Canadian surplus had been almost entirely due to trade with the United States. Canada has trade deficits with Europe and Asia, just as the Americans do. In 2005, Canada exported about $109 billion worth of goods more than they imported from the U.S.  With the rest of the world, Canada had a trade deficit of $47 billion creating an overall surplus of some $62 billion.<ref>[http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/gblec02a.htm Imports, exports and trade balance of goods on a balance-of-payments basis, by country or country grouping]. Statistics Canada.</ref>

==Income==
Although wealth is more highly concentrated in the U.S., the [[median]] (50th percentile) worker has essentially the same purchasing power in each nation.  In terms of [[purchasing power parity]], the most recent statistics from the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] has Canada (US $35,494) lower than that in the United States (US $43,444).<ref>[[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita]]</ref>

In the late 1990s, the GDP gap widened. In this period, GDP increased by 5% annually in the United States, and 2% in Canada. Earlier, it had been narrowing between 1961 and 1995. However, it was closing at a much faster rate in the 1960s than the early 1990s. From 1961 to 1973, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5.5% in Canada and 4.0% in the United States. From 1973 to 1995 it was 2.6% in Canada and 2.3% in the USA. [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1997/12/pdf/salgado.pdf]  Canada was not hit as hard by the economic downturn in 2001, however, so cumulative growth in real GDP has been almost exactly the same amount in each country over the last 15 years.

==Standard of living==
The [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Index]] ranks the United States (fourth) higher than Canada (eighth).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2010_EN_Table1.pdf|title=HDR_2010_EN_Table1}}</ref> Other independent groups, such as the ''[[The Economist|Economist]]'' have ranked each of Canada's four largest cities as better places to live than any American city. In their 2005 ranking, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa ranked within the top 10 [[livable]] cities while the highest-ranked American cities, Cleveland and Pittsburgh, were tied at 26th place.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4306936.stm Vancouver is 'best place to live']"  BBC News, Tuesday, 4 October 2005</ref>

Canada ranks higher than the U.S. in statistics such as [[life expectancy]] (80.22 years in Canada versus 77.85 in the U.S.) and [[infant mortality]] (4.75 Canadian deaths per 1000 versus 6.50 in the States). Both countries rank highly with 99% [[literacy]] rates. The United States has more major consumer goods per capita than Canada. For instance, while Canada had only 297 computers per 1000 people in 1996, the United States had 403.

Average income is slightly higher in the United States.  However, the gap in median incomes is minor.  In terms of racial disparity, United States [[African-American]]s and [[Hispanic]]s have a lower standard of living than the rest of the population; in Canada, [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]] and [[Black Canadian]]s are disproportionately likely to live in poverty, although these groups represent 25% of the US population and only 6% of Canada's. In both countries, recent immigrants tend to have lower earnings than more established residents. Canada's [[French-Canadians]] also used to be a poorer group, but since the [[Quiet Revolution]] in the 1960s this has been partially remedied.

The United States measures poverty, while Canada does not have an official measure (see [[Poverty in Canada#Measures of poverty in Canada]]), although [[Statistics Canada]] measures something called the [[Low-Income Cutoffs]], the statistical agency repeatedly states that this is not a poverty measure (it is an income dispersion measure like the [[Gini coefficient]]).  In the United States the poverty line is set at triple the "minimum adequate food budget." When a common measure is used, such as that of the [[Luxembourg Income Study]], the United States has higher rates. The LIS reports that Canada has a poverty rate of 15.4% and the United States 18.7%. [http://www.cfc-efc.ca/docs/ccsd/00000324.htm] In both countries lower incomes are found in those most affected by poverty include single-parent families and single elderly people.

It may be said the cost of absorbing lower skilled, poorer workers in the US skews comparison studies downward for the United States<ref name=wagelevels>[http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/89-001-XIE/89-001-XIE2007001.pdf The Impact of Immigration on Labour Markets in Canada, Mexico, and the United States], [[Statistics Canada]], Update on Family and Labour Studies, May 2007, URL Accessed 26 May 2007</ref> (see also [[Economic impact of illegal immigrants in the United States]]).  In recent years, what otherwise would have been a reduction in the low-income cutoff, was more than offset by the impact of immigration.  According to a 2003 study by Statistics Canada "The rise in the low-income rates in the three major Canadian cities, and in Ontario and B.C. during the 1990s in particular, was largely concentrated among the immigrant population. Basically, low-income rates have been falling over the past two decades among the Canadian born, and rising among immigrants."<ref name=PicotHou>[http://dissemination.statcan.ca/english/research/11F0019MIE/11F0019MIE2003198.pdf The rise in low-income rates among immigrants in Canada], Analytical Studies Branch research paper series, [[Statistics Canada]], June 2003, URL accessed 20 September 2006</ref> A more recent January 2007 study by Statistics Canada explains that the low-income rates of new immigrants has deteriorated by yet another significant amount from 2000 to 2004<ref name=PicotHouUpdated>[http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/11F0019MIE/11F0019MIE2007294.pdf Chronic Low Income and Low-income Dynamics Among Recent Immigrants], [[Statistics Canada]], January 2007, URL accessed 30 January 2007</ref> (see also [[Economic impact of immigration to Canada]]).

==Home ownership==
While [[owner-occupier|home ownership]] rates in both countries are very high compared to worldwide (or even developed countries), the United States has a slightly higher level of home ownership at 68.9% [http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/hvs/annual05/ann05t12.html]  versus 67% for Canada [http://realtytimes.com/rtcpages/20050310_canmarket.htm]. This number has converged in recent years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
