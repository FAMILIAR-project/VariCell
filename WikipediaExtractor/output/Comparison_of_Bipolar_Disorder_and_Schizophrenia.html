   <h1 class="article-heading">Comparison of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia</h1> 
   <div class="article-content"> 
    <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{Multiple issues|...}}</span> </p> 
    <p> <a href="Schizophrenia">Schizophrenia</a> and <a href="bipolar disorder">bipolar disorder</a> are <a href="mental diseases">mental diseases</a> (used interchangeably with disorder) that the <a href="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> fourth edition (DSM IV) lists under <a href="psychotic disorders">psychotic disorders</a>. Because of their very similar <a href="symptoms">symptoms</a>, differentiating between the two tends to be difficult. Specific aspects of each disease makes the diagnosis clearer to the <a href="psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a>. </p> 
    <p> While symptoms are a main way to diagnose either diseases, recent studies are allowing psychiatrists to use <a href="magnetic resonance imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI) scans to create better, definite diagnoses. Through MRIs, the psychiatrists can see specific structural differences in the brain. These differences include volume of <a href="gray matter">gray matter</a>, <a href="Neuropathology">neuropathological</a> size differences variations, and <a href="cortex (anatomy)">cortical</a> thickness, which then leads to cognitive differences on tests. These differences are seen throughout the lifespan of the diseases, and often occur soon after the initial episode. Although the diseases are different, some of their treatments are similar, because of their shared symptoms. </p> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2> Symptoms </h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> The symptoms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia tend to overlap, and thus it is often problematic for <a href="psychiatrists">psychiatrists</a> to properly <a href="diagnose">diagnose</a> the diseases. </p> 
      <div class="section"> 
       <h3> Depression </h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> The most common symptom overlap of the diseases is <a href="depression (mood)">depression</a>. Patients of either diseases experience depressive periods, in which they are lethargic, fatigued, <a href="insomnia">insomniac</a>, have thoughts of <a href="suicide">suicide</a>, or other negative thoughts.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Bipolar patients go through states of depression and <a href="mania">mania</a>, while schizophrenics are depressive in their acts most of the time. Therefore, a way to at least establish between bipolar disorder and schizophrenics is to observe depressive patterns. If the depressive state is altered with states of mania for periods of time, the patient is more likely to be diagnosed as bipolar than schizophrenic. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> However, even with in this, the manic stage can also be questionable. </p> 
       </div> 
      </div> 
      <div class="section"> 
       <h3> Hallucinations </h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> Often, the driving force in diagnosing between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is the presence of <a href="hallucinations">hallucinations</a> in schizophrenic patients. However, sometimes this can cause failure in diagnosis as well. The manic stage of bipolar patents, in some cases, can be so disorganized and jumbled that the patients experience hallucinations as well. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The way for psychiatrists to properly determine whether the hallucinations are a result of schizophrenia or of the manic stage is through the expressiveness of the patient. Bipolar disorder patients are much more expressive, while schizophrenic patients are monotone in their expression of their hallucinations. In addition, the manic stages of bipolar patients in which these hallucinations would occur much more often than for schizophrenic patients.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> Because these are the main symptoms of bipolar disorder, if a patient does things outside of these symptoms, he or she is likely to be schizophrenic instead. It is important to note that bipolar patients, during their manic stage, do not all experience hallucinations. They are more likely to be jumpy and always wanting to take on new tasks, without finishing any.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Since hallucinations are less common in bipolar disorder, this symptom, unlike depression, is not as problematic in differentiating the two diseases. </p> 
       </div> 
      </div> 
     </div> 
    </div> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2> Gray Matter </h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> Gray matter consists <a href="neural">neural</a> cells that are found in the region of the brain that attribute to muscle control and <a href="sensory perception">sensory perception</a>, so it is not surprising to find that the volume of these cells have the propensity to increase and decrease in the brains of bipolar disorder or schizophrenic patients. </p> 
      <p> Schizophrenic patients have gray matter volume loss in both hemispheres of the brain. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The most significant losses are in the left <a href="thalamus">thalamus</a> and right <a href="caudate nucleus">caudate</a>, and this loss extends into the <a href="cerebrum">cerebrum</a>, <a href="parahippocampal gyrus">parahippocampal gyrus</a>, and the <a href="hippocampus">hippocampus</a>. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> There are increases in the <a href="temporal lobe">temporal</a> and <a href="parietal lobe">parietal</a> lobes, along with the <a href="anterior">anterior</a> cerebellum. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> When schizophrenic patients are compared to healthy participants, there is a decrease in gray matter volume in <a href="prefrontal">prefrontal</a> and temporal regions. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The only region in which the volume increases for gray matter is within the right <a href="cerebellum">cerebellum</a>, which makes sense because this area contributes to the <a href="cognitive">cognitive</a>, <a href="affective">affective</a>, <a href="perceptual">perceptual</a>, and other deficits seen in schizophrenics. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder has very little differences for gray matter volume. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Overall, there is no difference between bipolar patients and healthy patients. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Thus, it is relatively easy to distinguish between the two diseases when using a <a href="magnetic resonance imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI) system. </p> 
     </div> 
    </div> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2> Neuropathological </h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> By comparing MRIs, researchers discovered that participants with schizophrenia have significantly smaller <a href="amygdala">amygdala</a> than those with psychotic bipolar disorder, as well as against the healthy groups. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> There is no significant difference between the healthy group and those who are diagnosed with psychotic bipolar disorder. An important note to consider is that patients with bipolar disorders are commonly treated with mood stabilizers like lithium, which increase amygdala size over time. In recent studies, this consideration was not explicitly stated; many of the bipolar disorder patients were on lithium, while none of the schizophrenic patients were. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Thus, it is possible that the size differences of the amygdala are due to medication rather than disease. Even so, the amygdala might still be a place of partially shared <a href="pathophysiology">pathophysiology</a> between these disorders. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Besides the amygdala, there are other neuropathological areas of degeneration as well; the overall brain volume can also measured. Research shows that the overall brain volume is not statistically significantly different between bipolar and schizophrenic patients, except when making comparisons in the intracranial volume.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> A larger intracranial volume is present in the brains in bipolar disorder, but no variation occurs in the brains in schizophrenics. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
     </div> 
    </div> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2> Treatment </h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> Because both disorders are not ?curable,? treatments are meant to make the diseases more tolerable for the patients. Treatments for the diseases include <a href="medication">medication</a>, <a href="psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a>, and others. </p> 
      <div class="section"> 
       <h3> Medication </h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> Medication for the two diseases differs because of the nature of the diseases. Bipolar disorder patients have issues with mood, so usually mood-stabilizing medications, such as <a href="lithium">lithium</a>, are used. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Other types of medication are <a href="atypical antipsychotic">atypical antipsychotic</a>, which are second generation medication to treat <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a> and <a href="antidepressants">antidepressants</a>. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Schizophrenic patients mainly use <a href="antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a> medications. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
       </div> 
      </div> 
      <div class="section"> 
       <h3> Psychotherapy </h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> Psychotherapy is a treatment both types of disorder patients use. They guide the patients in their thoughts, and use communication as a means of healing. Families of the affected also benefit from this treatment, as they can sit on sessions and talk to the therapist as well. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
       </div> 
      </div>

       <h3> Other </h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> <a href="Psychiatric rehabilitation">Rehabilitation</a> is used mainly for schizophrenic patients, where they can learn the skills needed to function in society. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> <a href="Electroshock therapy">Electroshock therapy</a> is a type of therapy that bipolar disorder patients use when nothing else works. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> It is a small electric shock run through the body, and causes no harm to the patient. <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p>
