|-
| [[Think aloud protocol]]
| [[Software testing|Testing]]
| Design, coding, testing and release of application
| Participants in testing express their thoughts on the application while executing set tasks
| 
*Less expensive
*Results are close to what is experienced by users 
|
*The Environment is not natural to the user
|-
| [[Usability_testing#Remote_Usability_Testing|Remote Usability testing]]
| [[Software testing|Testing]]
| Design, coding, testing and release of application
| The experimenter does not directly observe the users while they use the application though activity may be recorded for subsequent viewing
| 
*Efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction, the three usability issues, are covered 
| 
*Additional Software is necessary to observe the participants from a distance
|-
| [[Focus group]]s	
| Inquiry 
| Testing and release of application
| A moderator guides a discussion with a group of users of the application
| 
*If done before prototypes are developed, can save money 
*Produces a lot of useful ideas from the users themselves
*Can improve customer relations
|
*The environment is not natural to the user and may provide inaccurate results.
*The data collected tends to have low validity due to the unstructured nature of the discussion
|-
| [[Interview]]s
| Inquiry
| Design, coding, testing and release of application
| The users are interviewed to find out about their experience and expectations
| 
*Good at obtaining detailed information
*Few participants are needed
*Can improve customer relations
|
*Can not be conducted remotely
*Does not address the usability issue of efficiency 
|-
| [[Cognitive walkthrough]]
| [[Software inspection|Inspection]]
| Design, coding, testing and release of application
| A team of evaluators walk through the application discussing usability issues through the use of a paper prototype or a working prototype
| 
*Good at refining requirements
*does not require a fully functional prototype
| 
*Does not address user satisfaction or efficiency 
*The designer may not behave as the average user when using the application
|-
| [[Pluralistic walkthrough]]
| [[Software inspection|Inspection]]
| Design
| A team of users, usability engineers and product developers review the usability of the paper prototype of the application
|
*Usability issues are resolved faster 
*Greater number of usability problems can be found at one time
|
*Does not address the usability issue of efficiency
