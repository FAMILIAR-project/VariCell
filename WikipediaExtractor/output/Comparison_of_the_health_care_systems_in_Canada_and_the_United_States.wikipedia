The U.S. spent 15.3% of GDP on health care in that year; Canada spent 10.0%.<ref name="OECD Canada"/> In 2006, 70% of health care spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46% in the United States. Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on health care was 23% higher than Canadian government spending, and U.S. government expenditure on health care was just under 83% of total Canadian spending (public and private) though these statistics don't take into account population differences.<ref>World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select_process.cfm?strISO3_select=ALL&strIndicator_select=nha&intYear_select=latest&fixed=country&language=english Core Health Indicators].

Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending. A 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that "health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent."<ref name="Open Medicine">{{cite journal | author = Guyatt G.H. ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = A systematic review of studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the United States | url = http://www.openmedicine.ca/article/view/8/1 | journal = Open Medicine | volume = 1 | page = 1 }}</ref> Life expectancy is longer in Canada, and its infant mortality rate is lower than that of the U.S., but there is debate about the underlying causes of these differences. 

One commonly cited comparison, the 2000 World Health Organization's ratings of "overall health service performance", which used a "composite measure of achievement in the level of health, the distribution of health, the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution", ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations.  This study rated the US "responsiveness", or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment, as 1st, compared with 7th for Canada.  While the average life expectancy for Canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the US,<ref name="WHO 2000">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/annex01_en.pdf |title=Health system attainment and performance in all Member States, ranked by eight measures, estimates for 1997 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> simply comparing the life expectancy of two groups with different racial makeup and different obesity rates is likely not an effective way of determining which healthcare system is superior.

The WHO's study methods were criticized by some analyses.
Although there is a measure of consensus that life-expectancy and infant mortality mark the most reliable ways to compare nation-wide health care, assuming the population makeup is similar, a recent report by the [[Congressional Research Service]] carefully summarizes some recent data and notes the "difficult research issues" facing international comparisons.<ref>Congressional Research Service, [http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34175_20070917.pdf "U.S. Health Care Spending: Comparison with Other OECD Countries"], September 17, 2007.  Order Code RL34175</ref>

==Government involvement==
In 2004, government funding of health care in Canada was equivalent to $US1,893 per person.  In the US, government spending per person was $2,728.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34175_20070917.pdf |title=Comparison with Other OECD Countries |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>

The Canadian healthcare system is composed of at least 10 mostly autonomous provincial healthcare systems that report to their provincial governments, and a federal system which covers veterans. This causes a significant degree of variation in funding and coverage within the country.

===History===
Canada and the US had similar health care systems in the early 1960s,<ref name="Szick"/> but now have a different mix of funding mechanisms. Canada's universal [[single-payer health care]] system covers about 70% of expenditures, and the [[Canada Health Act]] requires that all insured persons be fully insured, without co-payments or user fees, for all medically necessary hospital and physician care.  About 91% of hospital expenditures and 99% of total physician services are financed by the public sector.<ref>http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/944-e.htm</ref> Ophthalmology and dental services account for a lot of the private expenditures in Canada. In the United States, with its mixed public-private system, 16% or 45 million American residents are uninsured at any one time.<ref>[http://www.nchc.org/facts/coverage.shtml The National Coalition on Health Care, Facts About Healthcare ? Health Insurance Coverage.]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> The U.S. is one of two [[OECD]] countries not to have some form of universal health coverage, the other being Turkey. Mexico established a universal healthcare program by November 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecdwash.org/PDFILES/health2003_wash.pdf |title = Reforming Health Systems in OECD Countries |accessdate=2007-07-11 |last=Docteur |first=Elizabeth |date=2003-06-23 |format=PDF |work=Presentation, OECD Breakfast Series in Partnership with NABE. |publisher=OECD |page = page 20}}</ref>

===Health insurance===
The governments of both nations are closely involved in health care. The central structural difference between the two is in [[health insurance]]. In Canada, the federal government is committed to providing funding support to its provincial governments for health care expenditures as long as the province in question abides by accessibility guarantees as set out in the [[Canada Health Act]], which explicitly prohibits billing end users for procedures that are covered by [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]]. While some label Canada's system as "socialized medicine," the term is inaccurate.  Unlike systems with public delivery, such as the UK, the Canadian system provides public coverage for a combination of public and private delivery.  As Princeton University health economist Uwe E. Reinhardt notes, single-payer systems are not "socialized medicine" but "social insurance" systems, because doctors are in the private sector.<ref>Reinhardt, U.E. ''et al.'' [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118411829790962883.html Letters: For Children's Sake, This 'Schip' Needs to Be Relaunched.] ''Wall Street Journal'', July 11, 2007.</ref>  Similarly, Canadian hospitals are controlled by private boards and/or regional health authorities, rather than being part of government.

In the US, direct government funding of health care is limited to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP), which cover eligible senior citizens, the very poor, disabled persons, and children. The federal government also runs the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], which provides care to retired or disabled veterans, their families, and survivors through medical centers and clinics.

The U.S. government also runs the military health system. In Fiscal Year 2007, the MHS had total budget authority of $39.4 billion and served approximately 9.1 million beneficiaries, including Active Duty personnel and their families and retirees and their families. The MHS includes 133,000 personnel, 86,000 military and 47,000 civilian, working at more than 1,000 locations worldwide, including 70 inpatient facilities and 1,085 medical, dental, and veterans' clinics.

One study estimates that about 25 percent of the uninsured in the U.S. are eligible for these programs but remain unenrolled; however, extending coverage to all who are eligible remains a fiscal and political challenge.<ref name="Kaiser Uninsured">{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/7613.pdf |title=Characteristics of the Uninsured: Who is Eligible for Public Coverage and Who Needs Help Affording Coverage?  |accessdate=2007-07-19 |format=PDF |work=Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured }}</ref>

For everyone else, health insurance must be paid for privately. Some 59% of U.S. residents have access to health care insurance through employers, although this figure is decreasing, and coverages as well as workers' expected contributions vary widely.<ref name="Census 2007">{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p60-235.pdf| title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-26 | format=PDF |work=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref> Those whose employers do not offer health insurance, as well as those who are self-employed or unemployed, must purchase it on their own. Nearly 27 million of the 45 million uninsured U.S. residents worked at least part-time in 2007, and more than a third were in households that earned $50,000 or more per year.<ref name="Census 2007" />

===Funding===
Despite the greater role of private business in the US, federal and state agencies are increasingly involved in health care spending, paying about 45% of the $2.2 trillion the nation spent on medical care in 2004.<ref>{{cite news |first=Julie |last=Appleby |title=Universal care appeals to USA |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/2006-10-15-universal-usat_x.htm |work=USA Today |date=2006-10-16 |accessdate=2007-05-22 }}</ref> The U.S. government spends more on health care than on Social Security and national defense combined, according to the [[Brookings Institution]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opportunity08.org/Files/FD.ashx?guid=98a417e5-5972-4031-b361-e11e00981f55 |title=Meeting the Dilemma of Health Care Access |accessdate=2007-06-21 |format=PDF |work=Opportunity 08: A Project of the Brookings Institution }}</ref>

Beyond its direct spending, the US government is also highly involved in health care through regulation and legislation. For example, the [[Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973]] provided grants and loans to subsidize [[Health Maintenance Organizations]] and contained provisions to stimulate their popularity. HMOs had been declining before the law; by 2002 there were 500 such plans enrolling 76 million people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/6225.php |title=Health Care Expenditures in the USA |accessdate=2007-07-18 |work=National Center for Health Statistics | publisher=Medical News Today}}</ref>

The Canadian system has been 69?75% [[publicly funded health care|publicly funded]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/36/38979632.xls |title=OECD Health Data 2007 ? Frequently Requested Data |accessdate=2007-08-27 |format=Excel |work=OECD }}</ref> though most services are delivered by private providers, including physicians (although they may derive their revenue primarily from government billings). Although some doctors work on a purely fee-for-service basis (usually family physicians), some family physicians and most specialists are paid through a combination of fee-for-service and fixed contracts with hospitals or health service management organizations.

Canada's universal health plan does not cover certain services.  Non-cosmetic [[Dentistry|dental care]] is covered for children up to age 14 in some provinces.  Outpatient prescription drugs are not required to be covered, but some provinces have drug cost programs that cover most drug costs for certain populations.  In every province, seniors receiving the [[Guaranteed Income Supplement]] have significant additional coverage; some provinces expand forms of drug coverage to all seniors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coverme.com/LH/CoverMe/miniWhy/English/NotCovered/A_NS.html |title=CoverMe Government Health Insurance Coverage |publisher=Coverme.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> low-income families,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coverme.com/LH/CoverMe/miniWhy/English/NotCovered/A_SK.html |title=CoverMe Government Health Insurance Coverage |publisher=Coverme.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> those on social assistance,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coverme.com/LH/CoverMe/miniWhy/English/NotCovered/A_NF.html |title=CoverMe Government Health Insurance Coverage |publisher=Coverme.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> or those with certain medical conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnb.ca/0212/intro-e.asp |title=Health ?

Also, some procedures are only covered under certain circumstances. For example, [[circumcision]] is not covered, and a fee is usually charged when a parent requests the procedure; however, if an infection or [[medical necessity]] arises, the procedure would be covered.

According to Dr. Albert Schumacher, former president of the Canadian Medical Association, an estimated 75 percent of Canadian health care services are delivered privately, but funded publicly.
<blockquote>"Frontline practitioners whether they're GPs or specialists by and large are not salaried. They're small hardware stores. Same thing with labs and radiology clinics ?The situation we are seeing now are more services around not being funded publicly but people having to pay for them, or their insurance companies. We have sort of a passive privatization."<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/public_vs_private.html Public vs. private health care.] ''CBC'', December 1, 2006.</ref></blockquote>

==Coverage and access==
In both Canada and the United States, access to health care can be a problem. Studies suggest that 40% of U.S. citizens do not have adequate health insurance, if any at all. In Canada, however, as many as 5% of Canadian citizens have not been able to find a regular doctor, with a further 9% having never looked for one.  Yet, even if some cannot find a family doctor, every Canadian citizen is covered by the national health care system.  The U.S. data is evidenced in a 2007 Consumer Reports study on the U.S. health care system which showed that the underinsured account for 24% of the U.S. population and live with skeletal health insurance that barely covers their medical needs and leaves them unprepared to pay for major medical expenses.  When added to the population of uninsured (approximately 16% of the U.S. population), a total of 40% of Americans ages 18?64 have inadequate access to health care, according to the Consumer Reports study.<ref>[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/08/cu_insurance.html Consumer Reports Study on the Uninsured], 08-07-06</ref> The Canadian data comes from the 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey,<ref name="Statcan">[http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/040615/d040615b.htm Canadian Community Health Survey], 04-06-15</ref>

In the U.S., the federal government does not guarantee [[universal health care]] to all its citizens, but [[publicly funded health care]] programs help to provide for the elderly, disabled, the poor, and children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov |title=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services |accessdate=2007-06-20 }}</ref> The [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] or EMTALA also ensures public access to [[emergency services]]. The EMTALA law forces emergency health care providers to stabilize an emergency health crisis and cannot withhold treatment for lack of evidence of insurance coverage or other evidence of the ability to pay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EMTALA/ |title=Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services: Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act |publisher=Cms.hhs.gov |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> EMTALA does not absolve the person receiving emergency care of the obligation to meet the cost of emergency health care not paid for at the time and it is still within the right of the hospital to pursue any debtor for the cost of emergency health care provided. In Canada, emergency room treatment for legal Canadian residents is not charged to the patient at time of service but is met by the government.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], 59.3% of U.S. citizens have [[health insurance]] related to employment, 27.8% have government-provided health-insurance; nearly 9% purchase health insurance directly (there is some overlap in these figures), and 15.3% (45.7 million) were uninsured in 2007.<ref name="Census 2007"/> An estimated 25 percent of the uninsured are eligible for government programs but unenrolled.<ref name="Kaiser Uninsured" /> About a third of the uninsured are in households earning more than $50,000 annually.<ref name="Census 2007"/><ref>Seymour, J.A.

A number of [[free clinic|clinics]] provide free or low-cost non-emergency care to poor, uninsured patients. The National Association of Free Clinics claims that its member clinics provide $3 billion in services to some 3.5 million patients annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freeclinics.us/AboutUs/tabid/54/Default.aspx |title=National Association of Free Clinics: About Us |accessdate=2007-06-20 }}</ref>

A peer-reviewed comparison study of health care access in the two countries published in 2006 concluded that U.S. residents are one third less likely to have a regular medical doctor, one fourth more likely to have unmet health care needs, and are more than twice as likely to forgo needed medicines.<ref name="Lasser et al." /> The study noted that access problems "were particularly dire for the US uninsured." Those who lack insurance in the U.S. were much less satisfied, less likely to have seen a doctor, and more likely to have been unable to receive desired care than both Canadians and insured Americans.<ref name="Lasser et al." />

Another cross-country study compared access to care based on immigrant status in Canada and the U.S.<ref>Lebrun LA & Dubay LC. (2010). Access to primary and preventive care among foreign-born adults in Canada and the United States. ''Health Services Research'', Sept 1, 2010, 1?27 (Epub).http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2010.01163.x/abstract</ref> Findings showed that in both countries, immigrants had worse access to care than non-immigrants. Specifically, immigrants living in Canada were less likely to have timely Pap tests compared with native-born Canadians; in addition, immigrants in the U.S. were less likely to have a regular medical doctor and an annual consultation with a health care provider compared with native-born Americans. In general, immigrants in Canada had better access to care than those in the U.S., but most of the differences were explained by differences in socioeconomic status (income, education) and insurance coverage across the two countries. However, immigrants in the U.S. were more likely to have timely Pap tests than immigrants in Canada.

[[Cato Institute]] has expressed concerns that the U.S. government has restricted the freedom of Medicare patients to spend their own money on health care, and has contrasted these developments with the situation in Canada, where in 2005 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the province of Quebec could not prohibit its citizens from purchasing covered services through private health insurance. The institute has urged the Congress to restore the right of American seniors to spend their own money on medical care.<ref>Kent Masterson Brown, [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8737 "The Freedom to Spend Your Own Money on Medical Care: A Common Casualty of Universal Coverage"], CATO Institute Policy Analysis no. 601, October 15, 2007</ref>

==Wait times==
One complaint about both the U.S. and Canadian health care systems is waiting times, whether for a specialist, major elective surgery, such as hip replacement, or specialized treatments, such as radiation for breast cancer; wait times in each country are affected by various factors. In the United States, access to health care is primarily determined by whether a person has access to funding to pay for treatment and by the availability of services in the area and by willingness of the provider to deliver service at the price set by the insurer. In Canada the wait time is set according to the availability of services in the area and by the relative need of the person needing treatment. In addition, the doctor-to-patient ratio is lower in Canada than in the United States. According to a 2009 Commonwealth consensus, Veteran's hospitals in Pennsylvania and New York, respectively, have more doctors available separately than in Canada.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

As reported by the [[Health Council of Canada]], a 2010 Commonwealth survey found that 42% of Canadians waited 2 hours or more in the emergency room, vs. 29% in the U.S.; 43% waited 4 weeks or more to see a specialist, vs. 10% in the U.S. The same survey states that 37% of Canadians say it is difficult to access care after hours (evenings, weekends or holidays) without going to the emergency department over 34% of Americans.  Furthermore, 47% of Canadians, and 50% of Americans who visited emergency departments over the past two years feel that they could have been treated at their normal place of care if they were able to get an appointment.<ref name=HCC_CommWealth2010>{{cite web|title=How Do Canadians Rate the Health Care System?|url=http://healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=shop.flypage&product_id=120&category_id=20&manufacturer_id=0&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=170|publisher=Health Council of Canada|accessdate=August 9, 2011}}</ref>

Because Medicaid payments are low, some have claimed that some doctors do not want to see Medicaid patients.

Studies by the [[Commonwealth Fund]] found that 42% of Canadians waited 2 hours or more in the emergency room, vs. 29% in the U.S.; 57% waited 4 weeks or more to see a specialist, vs. 23% in the U.S., but Canadians had more chances of getting medical attention at nights, or on weekends and holidays than their American neighbors without the need to visit an ER (54% compared to 61%).<ref>Commonwealth Fund, Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: An International update on the comparative performance of American health care, Karen Davis et al., May 15, 2007.</ref>  Statistics from the Canadian free market think tank [[Fraser Institute]] in 2008 indicate that the average wait time between the time when a general practitioner refers a patient for care and the receipt of treatment was almost four and a half months in 2008, roughly double what it had been 15 years before.<ref>Sally Pipes, President and CEO of the [[Pacific Research Institute]], writing in ''[[The Washington Examiner]]'', [http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columns/special-editorial-reports/Canadian-patients-face-long-waits-for-low-tech-healthcare-47035532.html "Canadian patients face long waits for low-tech healthcare"], June 4, 2009, page 24</ref>

A 2003 survey of hospital administrators conducted in Canada, the U.S., and three other countries found dissatisfaction with both the U.S. and Canadian systems.  For example, 21% of Canadian hospital administrators, but less than 1% of American administrators, said that it would take over three weeks to do a biopsy for possible breast cancer on a 50-year-old woman; 50% of Canadian administrators versus none of their American counterparts said that it would take over six months for a 65-year-old to undergo a routine hip replacement surgery. However, U.S. administrators were the most negative about their country's health care system. Hospital executives in all five countries expressed concerns about staffing shortages and emergency department waiting times and quality.<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2001977834_cihak13.html  Guest columnist: The truth about Canada's ailing health-care system], By Robert J.

In a letter to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the President and CEO of University Health Network, Toronto, said that [[Michael Moore]]'s film ''[[Sicko]]'' "exaggerated the performance of the Canadian health system&nbsp;? there is no doubt that too many patients still stay in our emergency departments waiting for admission to scarce hospital beds." However, "Canadians spend about 55% of what Americans spend on health care and have longer life expectancy, and lower infant mortality rates. Many Americans have access to quality health care. All Canadians have access to similar care at a considerably lower cost." There is "no question" that the lower cost has come at the cost of "restriction of supply with sub-optimal access to services," said Bell. A new approach is targeting waiting times, which are reported on public websites.<ref>[http://www.health.gov.on.ca/transformation/wait_times/wait_mn.html Ontario Wait Times.] From: health.gov.on.ca.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancercare.on.ca |title=Cancer Care Ontario |publisher=Cancercare.on.ca |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref><ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118394504633260585.html "Canadian and U.S. Health Services ?

Holmes had characterized her condition as an emergency, said she was losing her sight, and portrayed her condition as a life-threatening brain cancer.
In July 2009 Holmes agreed to appear in television ads broadcast in the United States warning Americans of the dangers of adopting a Canadian style health care system.
The ads she appeared in triggered debates on both sides of the border.
After her ad appeared critics pointed out discrepancies in her story, including that [[Rathke's cleft cyst]], the condition she was treated for, was not a form of cancer, and was not life-threatening.<ref name=CbcShonaExaggeration>

==Price of health care and administration overheads==
Health care is one of the most expensive items of both nations? budgets. In the United States, the various levels of government spend more per capita on health care than levels of government do in Canada. In 2004, Canada government-spending was $2,120 (in US dollars) per person on health care, while the United States government-spending $2,724.<ref name="WHO">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select_process.cfm?countries=all&indicators=nha |title=World Health Organization: Core Health Indicators |accessdate=2007-06-20 }}</ref>

A 1999 report found that after exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0% of health care expenditures in the United States, as compared with 16.7% of health care expenditures in Canada.  In looking at the insurance element, in Canada, the provincial single-payer insurance system operated with overheads of 1.3%, comparing favourably with private insurance overheads (13.2%), U.S. private insurance overheads (11.7%) and U.S. Medicare and Medicaid program overheads (3.6% and 6.8% respectively). The report concluded by observing that gap between U.S. and Canadian spending on health care administration had grown to $752 per capita and that a large sum might be saved in the United States if the U.S. implemented a Canadian-style health care system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/publications/nejmadmin.pdf |title="Costs of Health Care Administration in the United States and Canada" (2003) Steffie Woolhandler, Terry Campbell, David U. Himmelstein, '&#39;The New England Journal of Medicine'&#39; |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>

However, U.S. government spending covers less than half of all health care costs. Private spending for health care is also far greater in the U.S. than in Canada. In Canada, an average of $917 was spent annually by individuals or private insurance companies for health care, including dental, eye care, and drugs. In the U.S., this sum is $3,372.<ref name="WHO"/> In 2006, health care consumed 15.3% of U.S. annual GDP. In Canada, only 10% of GDP was spent on health care.<ref name="OECD Canada"/> This difference is a relatively recent development. In 1971 the nations were much closer, with Canada spending 7.1% of GDP on health while the U.S. spent 7.6%.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Some who advocate against greater government involvement in health care have asserted that the difference in health care costs between the two nations is partially explained by the differences in their demographics.<ref>Sheldon L.

The mixed system in the United States has become more similar to the Canadian system. In recent decades, [[managed care]] has become prevalent in the United States, with some 90% of privately insured Americans belonging to plans with some form of managed care.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdecisions.org/LearningCenter/Facts.aspx |title=Fast Facts |accessdate=2007-07-18 |work=HealthDecisions.org | publisher=America's Health Insurance Plans}}</ref> In ''managed care'', insurance companies control patients' health care to reduce costs, for instance by demanding a second opinion prior to some expensive treatments or by denying coverage for treatments not considered worth their cost.

Administrative costs for health care are also higher in the United States than in Canada.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Woolhandler S, Campbell T, Himmelstein DU |title=Costs of health care administration in the United States and Canada |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=349 |issue=8 |pages=768?75 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12930930 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa022033 |url=}}</ref>

===Medical professionals===
Some of the extra money spent in the United States goes to [[physicians]], nurses, and other medical professionals. According to health data collected by the [[OECD]], average income for physicians in the United States in 1996 was nearly twice that for physicians in Canada.<ref>[http://www.econedlink.org/lessons/docs_lessons/535_DaigneaultLajoie1.pdf Health Care Systems: An International Comparison.] Strategic Policy and Research Intergovernmental Affairs, May 2001.</ref>

Canada has fewer doctors per capita than the United States. In the U.S, there were 2.4 doctors per 1,000 people in 2005; in Canada, there were 2.2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/document/16/0,3343,en_2825_495642_2085200_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Health Data 2007: Frequently Requested Data |accessdate=2007-07-19 |format=Excel spreadsheet |work=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development}}</ref> Some doctors leave Canada to pursue career goals or higher pay in the U.S., though significant numbers of physicians from countries such as [[India]], Pakistan and South Africa immigrate to practice in Canada. Many Canadian physicians and new medical graduates also go to the U.S. for post-graduate training in medical residencies. As it is a much larger market, new and cutting-edge sub-specialties are more widely available in the U.S. as opposed to Canada. However, statistics published in 2005 by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), show that, for the first time since 1969 (the period for which data are available), more physicians returned to Canada than moved abroad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=PG_587_E&cw_topic=587&cw_rel=AR_14_E |title=Supply, Distribution and Migration of Canadian Physicians, 2005 |accessdate=2007-07-11 | date=2006-10-12 |format=PDF |publisher=Canadian Institute for Health Information |pages=page 40, figure 10 |quote=...in the past two years, the number of physicians returning from abroad has exceeded the number of physicians moving abroad.}}</ref>

===Drugs===
Both Canada and the United States have limited programs to provide prescription drugs to the needy. In the U.S., the introduction of [[Medicare Part D]] has extended partial coverage for pharmaceuticals to Medicare beneficiaries. In Canada all drugs given in hospitals fall under Medicare, but other prescriptions do not. The provinces all have some programs to help the poor and seniors have access to drugs, but while there have been calls to create one, no national program exists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/07/30/pharma_040730.html |title=Premiers propose drug plan paid for by Ottawa |publisher=CBC |date=2004-08-03 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> About two thirds of Canadians have private prescription drug coverage, mostly through their employers.<ref name="OECD Pharmaceuticals">Val?rie Paris and Elizabeth Docteur. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/21/40/37868186.pdf Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Policies in Canada] OECD Health Working Papers</ref> In both countries, there is a significant population not fully covered by these programs. A 2005 study found that 20% of Canada's and 40% of America's sicker adults did not fill a prescription because of cost.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schoen C, Osborn R, Huynh PT, ''et al.'' |title=Taking the pulse of health care systems: experiences of patients with health problems in six countries |journal=Health affairs (Project Hope) |volume=Suppl Web Exclusives |pages=W5?509?25 |year=2005  |pmid=16269444 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.w5.509 |url=}}</ref>

Furthermore, the 2010 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey indicates that 4% of Canadians indicated that they did not visit a doctor because of cost compared with 22% of Americans.  Additionally, 21% of Americans have said that they did not fill a prescription for medicine or have skipped doses due to cost.  That is compared with 10% of Canadians.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

One of the most important differences between the two countries is the much higher cost of drugs in the United States. In the U.S., $728 per capita is spent each year on drugs, while in Canada it is $509.<ref name="OECD Pharmaceuticals"/> At the same time, consumption is higher in Canada, with about 12 prescriptions being filled per person each year in Canada and 10.6 in the United States.<ref>Val?rie Paris and Elizabeth Docteur. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/21/40/37868186.pdf Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Policies in Canada] OECD Health Working Papers pg. 49</ref> The main difference is that patented drug prices in Canada average between 35% and 45% lower than in the United States, though generic prices are higher.<ref>Val?rie Paris and Elizabeth Docteur.

There are several reasons for the disparity. The Canadian system takes advantage of centralized buying by the provincial governments that have more market heft and buy in bulk, lowering prices. By contrast, the U.S. has explicit laws that prohibit [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or [[Medicaid]] from negotiating drug prices. In addition, price negotiations by Canadian health insurers are based on evaluations of the clinical effectiveness of prescription drugs,<ref name="AARP">Gross, David. "[http://www.aarp.org/research/international/perspectives/jul_03_rxprices_canada.html Prescription Drug Prices in Canada: What Are the Lessons for the U.S.?]" ''[[AARP]].'' July 2003. Retrieved on February 3, 2008.</ref> allowing the relative prices of therapeutically-similar drugs to be considered in context. The Canadian Patented Medicine Prices Review Board also has the authority to set a fair and reasonable price on patented products, either comparing it to similar drugs already on the market, or by taking the average price in seven developed nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pmprb-cepmb.gc.ca/english/view.asp?x=654&mid=589 |title=Compendium of Guidelines, Policies and Procedures.

===Technology===
The United States spends more on technology than Canada. In a 2004 study on medical imaging in Canada,<ref>[http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_13jan2005_e "CIHI report shows increase in MRI and CT scanners, up more than 75% in the last decade."] ''Medical Imaging in Canada, 2004.''</ref> it was found that Canada had 4.6 [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scanners per million population while the U.S. had 19.5 per million.  Canada's 10.3 [[computerized tomography|CT scanners]] per million also ranked behind the U.S., which had 29.5 per million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_13jan2005_e |title=Press release: CIHI Report shows increase in MRI and CT scanners, up more than 75% in the last decade |publisher=Secure.cihi.ca |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> The study did not attempt to assess whether the difference in the number of MRI and CT scanners had any effect on the medical outcomes or were a result of overcapacity but did observe that MRI scanners are used more intensively in Canada than either the U.S. or Great Britain.<ref>[http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=PG_328_E&cw_topic=328&cw_rel=AR_1043_E#full Medical Imaging in Canada, 2004]. ISBN 1-55392-515-7.</ref> This disparity in the availability of technology, some believe, results in longer wait times.

According to the Health Council of Canada?s 2010 report "Decisions, Decisions: Family doctors as gatekeepers to prescription drugs and diagnostic imaging in Canada", the Canadian federal government invested $3 billion over 5 years (2000?2005) in relation to diagnostic imaging and agreed to invest a further $2 billion to reduce wait times.  These investments led to an increase in the number of scanners across Canada as well as the number of exams being performed.  The number of CT scanners increased from 198 to 465 and MRI scanners increased from 19 to 266 (more than tenfold) between 1990 and 2009. Similarly, the number of CT exams increased by 58% and MRI exams increased by 100% between 2003 and 2009. In comparison to other OECD countries, including the US, Canada?s rates of MRI and CT exams falls somewhere in the middle.  Nevertheless, the Canadian Association of Radiologists claims that as many as 30% of diagnostic imaging scans are inappropriate and contribute no useful information.<ref name=HCC_Decisions2010>{{cite web|title=Decisions,Decisions: Family Doctors as Gatekeepers to Prescription Drugs and Diagnostic Imaging in Canada|url=http://healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=shop.flypage&product_id=116&category_id=20&manufacturer_id=0&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=170|publisher=Health Council of Canada|accessdate=August 9, 2011}}</ref>

===Malpractice litigation===

The extra cost of [[malpractice]] lawsuits is a proportion of health spending in both the U.S. (1.7% in 2002)<ref>{{cite web |title=Limiting Tort Liability for Medical Malpractice | year=2005 |url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4968&type=0}}</ref> and Canada (0.27% in 2001 or $237 million). In Canada the total cost of settlements, legal fees, and insurance comes to $4 per person each year,<ref name="pmid16136632">{{cite journal |author=Anderson GF, Hussey PS, Frogner BK, Waters HR |title=Health spending in the United States and the rest of the industrialized world |journal=Health affairs (Project Hope) |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=903?14 |year=2004 |pmid=16136632 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.4.903 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/4/903.full.pdf+html}}</ref> but in the United States it is over $16.

===Ancillary expenses===
There are a number of ancillary costs that are higher in the U.S. Administrative costs are significantly higher in the U.S.; government mandates on record keeping and the diversity of insurers, plans and administrative layers involved in every transaction result in greater administrative effort. One recent study comparing administrative costs in the two countries found that these costs in the U.S. are roughly double what they are in Canada.<ref>{{cite journal |coauthors=Steffie Woolhandler, M.D., M.P.H., Terry Campbell, M.H.A., and David U.

==Health care outcomes==
In the [[WHO's ranking of health care systems|World Health Organization's rankings of health care system performance]] among 191 member nations published in 2000, Canada ranked 30th and the U.S. 37th, while the overall health of Canadians was ranked 35th and Americans 72nd.<ref name="WHO 2000"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html |title=The World Health Organization's ranking of the world's health systems |publisher=Photius.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>  However, the WHO's methodologies, which attempted to measure how efficiently health systems translate expenditure into health, generated broad debate and criticism.<ref>Deber, Raisa, [http://www.longwoods.com/product.php?productid=17238&cat=367&page=1 "Why Did the World Health Organization Rate Canada's Health System as 30th?

Researchers caution against inferring health care quality from some health statistics.  June O'Neill and Dave O'Neill point out that "...life expectancy and infant mortality are both poor measures of the efficacy of a health care system because they are influenced by many factors that are unrelated to the quality and accessibility of medical care".<ref>O'Neill, J., O'Neill, D. M., [http://www.nber.org/papers/w13429  "Health Status, Health Care and Inequality: Canada vs. the U.S."], National Bureau of Economic Research, NBER Working Paper 13429, September 2007.</ref>

In 2007, Gordon H. Guyatt et al. conducted a meta-analysis, or systematic review, of all studies that compared health outcomes for similar conditions in Canada and the U.S., in ''Open Medicine'', an open-access peer-reviewed Canadian medical journal. They concluded, "Available studies suggest that health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent." Guyatt identified 38 studies addressing conditions including cancer, coronary artery disease, chronic medical illnesses and surgical procedures. Of 10 studies with the strongest statistical validity, 5 favoured Canada, 2 favoured the United States, and 3 were equivalent or mixed. Of 28 weaker studies, 9 favoured Canada, 3 favoured the United States, and 16 were equivalent or mixed. Overall, results for mortality favoured Canada with a 5% advantage, but the results were weak and varied. The only consistent pattern was that Canadian patients fared better in kidney failure.<ref name="Open Medicine" />

Canadians are, overall, statistically healthier than Americans and show lower rates of many diseases such as various forms of cancer. On the other hand, evidence suggests that with respect to some illnesses (such as breast cancer), those who do get sick have a higher rate of cure in the U.S. than in Canada.<ref name="pmid15160806" />{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In terms of population health, [[life expectancy]] in 2006 was about two and a half years longer in Canada, with Canadians living to an average of 79.9 years and Americans 77.5 years.<ref name="OECD">{{cite web |url=http://www.oecdobserver.org/news/get_file.php3/id/25/file/OECDInFigures2006-2007.pdf |title=OECD in Figures 2006?2007 |accessdate=2007-06-21 |format=PDF |work=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development }}</ref> Infant and child mortality rates are also higher in the U.S.<ref name="OECD" /> Some comparisons suggest that the American system underperforms Canada's system as well as those of other industrialized nations with universal coverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/publications_show.htm?doc_id=482678 |title=Commonwealth Fund Study |publisher=Commonwealthfund.org |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> For example, a ranking by the World Health Organization of health care system performance among 191 member nations, published in 2000, ranked Canada 30th and the U.S. 37th, and the overall health of Canada 35th to the American 72nd.<ref name="WHO 2000" />  The WHO did not merely consider health care outcomes, but also placed heavy emphasis on the health disparities between rich and poor, funding for the health care needs of the poor, and the extent to which a country was reaching the potential health care outcomes they believed were possible for that nation. In an international comparison of 21 more specific quality indicators conducted by the Commonwealth Fund International Working Group on Quality Indicators, the results were more divided. One of the indicators was a tie, and in 3 others, data was unavailable from one country or the other. Canada performed better on 11 indicators; such as survival rates for colorectal cancer, [[childhood leukemia]], and kidney and liver transplants. The U.S. performed better on 6 indicators, including survival rates for breast and cervical cancer, and avoidance of childhood diseases such as pertussis and measles.  It should be noted that the 21 indicators were distilled from a starting list of 1000.  The authors state that, "It is an opportunistic list, rather than a comprehensive list."<ref name="pmid15160806">{{cite journal |author=Hussey PS, Anderson GF, Osborn R, ''et al.'' |title=How does the quality of care compare in five countries? |journal=Health affairs (Project Hope) |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=89?99 |year=2004 |pmid=15160806 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.23.3.89 |url=}}</ref>

Some of the difference in outcomes may also be related to lifestyle choices. The OECD found that Americans have slightly higher rates of smoking and alcohol consumption than do Canadians<ref name="OECD"/> as well as significantly higher rates of [[obesity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/82-620-MIE/2005001/articles/adults/aobesity.htm#5 |title=Adult obesity in Canada: Measured height and weight |publisher=Statcan.ca |date=2008-11-16 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>  A joint US-Canadian study found slightly higher smoking rates among Canadians.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhis/jcush_mainpage.htm The Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health (JCUSH).] CDC ? National Center for Health Statistics.</ref> Another study found that Americans have higher rates not only of obesity, but also of other health risk factors and chronic conditions, including physical inactivity, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<ref name="Lasser et al." />

While a Canadian [[systematic review]] stated that the differences in the health care systems of Canada and the United States could not alone explain differences in health care outcomes,<ref name="Szick"/> the study didn't consider that over 44,000 Americans die every year due to not having a single payer system for healthcare in the United States and it didn't consider the millions more that live without proper medical care due to a lack of insurance.<ref>http://www.pnhp.org/excessdeaths/health-insurance-and-mortality-in-US-adults.pdf</ref>

The United States and Canada have different racial makeups as well as different obesity and alcoholism rates, which would likely cause the US to have a shorter average life expectancy and higher infant mortality even with equal health care provided.  The US population is 12.2% African Americans and 16.3% Hispanic Americans (2010 Census), whereas Canada has only 2.5% African Canadians and 0.97% Hispanic Canadians (2006 Census). African Americans have higher mortality rates than any other racial or ethnic group for eight of the top ten causes of death.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hummer|first=RA,|coauthors=Ellison CG, Rogers RG, Moulton BE, Romero RR|title=Religious involvement and adult mortality in the United States: review and perspective|journal=Southern Medical Journal|year=2004|month=December|volume=97|issue=12|pages=1223?30|pmid=15646761|doi=10.1097/01.SMJ.0000146547.03382.94}}</ref>  The cancer incidence rate among African Americans is 10% higher than among European Americans.<ref name=Disparities>American Public Health Association (APHA), Eliminating Health Disparities: Toolkit (2004).</ref>  U.S. Latinos have higher rates of death from diabetes, liver disease, and infectious diseases than do non-Latinos.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Vega WA, Amaro H |title=Latino outlook: good health, uncertain prognosis |journal=Annual Review of Public Health |volume=15 |pages=39?67 |year=1994 |pmid=8054092 |doi=10.1146/annurev.pu.15.050194.000351}}</ref>  Adult African Americans and Latinos have approximately twice the risk as European Americans of developing diabetes.<ref name="Disparities"/>  The infant mortality rates for African Americans is twice that of whites.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Rawlings JS, Weir MR |title=Race- and rank-specific infant mortality in a US military population |journal=American Journal of Diseases of Children |volume=146 |issue=3 |pages=313?6 |year=1992 |month=March |pmid=1543178}}</ref>  Unfortunately, directly comparing infant mortality rates between countries is difficult, as countries have different definitions of what qualifies as an infant death.

Another issue with comparing the two healthcare systems is the baseline health of the patient's for which the systems must treat.  Canada has only half the obesity rate that the US healthcare system must deal with (14.3% vs 30.6%).<ref>{{cite web|title=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bmi30chart.png|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bmi30chart.png}}</ref>  On average, obesity reduces life expectancy by 6?7 years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peeters A, Barendregt JJ, Willekens F, Mackenbach JP, Al Mamun A, Bonneux L |title=Obesity in adulthood and its consequences for life expectancy: A life-table analysis |journal=Ann.

===Cancer===
Numerous studies have attempted to compare the rates of cancer incidence and mortality in Canada and the U.S., with varying results. Doctors who study cancer epidemiology warn that the diagnosis of cancer is subjective, and the ''reported'' incidence of a cancer will rise if screening is more aggressive, even if the ''real'' cancer incidence is the same.  Statistics from different sources may not be compatible if they were collected in different ways.  The proper interpretation of cancer statistics has been an important issue for many years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dickman PW, Adami HO |title=Interpreting trends in cancer patient survival |journal=Journal of internal medicine |volume=260 |issue=2 |pages=103?17 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16882274 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2796.2006.01677.x |url=}}</ref>  Dr. Barry Kramer of the [[National Institutes of Health]] points to the fact that cancer incidence rose sharply over the past few decades as screening became more common.  He attributes the rise to increased detection of benign early stage cancers that pose little risk of metastasizing.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/health/10skin.html Doctors Balk at Cancer Ad, Citing Lack of Evidence] By CHRISTIE ASCHWANDEN, New York Times, July 10, 2007</ref>  Furthermore, though patients who were treated for these benign cancers were at little risk, they often have trouble finding health insurance after the fact.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Cancer survival time increases with later years of diagnosis, because cancer treatment improves, so cancer survival statistics can only be compared for cohorts in the same diagnosis year. For example, as doctors in British Columbia adopted new treatments, survival time for patients with metastatic breast cancer increased from 438 days for those diagnosed in 1991?1992, to 667 days for those diagnosed in 1999?2001.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chia SK, Speers CH, D'yachkova Y, ''et al.'' |title=The impact of new chemotherapeutic and hormone agents on survival in a population-based cohort of women with metastatic breast cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=973?9 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17647245 |doi=10.1002/cncr.22867 |url=}}</ref>

An assessment by [[Health Canada]] found that cancer mortality rates are almost identical in the two countries.<ref>"Progress Report on Cancer Control in Canada." ''Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control'', 2004 pg. 11</ref> Another international comparison by the National Cancer Institute of Canada indicated that incidence rates for most, but not all, cancers were higher in the U.S. than in Canada during the period studied (1993?1997). Incidence rates for certain types, such as colorectal and stomach cancer, were actually higher in Canada than in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncic.cancer.ca/ncic/internet/standard/0,3621,84658243_85787780_379601028_langId-en,00.html |title=International variation in cancer incidence |accessdate=2007-07-02 |work=National Cancer Institute of Canada |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070403064200/http://www.ncic.cancer.ca/ncic/internet/standard/0,3621,84658243_85787780_379601028_langId-en,00.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-03}}</ref> In 2004, researchers published a study comparing health outcomes in the Anglo countries.

A few comparative studies have found that cancer survival rates vary more widely among different populations in the U.S. than they do in Canada. Mackillop and colleagues compared cancer survival rates in Ontario and the U.S. They found that cancer survival was more strongly correlated with socio-economic class in the U.S. than in Ontario. Furthermore, they found that the American survival advantage in the four highest quintiles was statistically significant. They strongly suspected that the difference due to prostate cancer was a result of greater detection of asymptomatic cases in the U.S.  Their data indicates that neglecting the prostate cancer data reduces the American advantage in the four highest quintiles and gives Canada a statistically significant advantage in the lowest quintile.  Similarly, they believe differences in screening mammography may explain part of the American advantage in breast cancer.  Exclusion of breast and prostate cancer data results in very similar survival rates for both countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boyd C, Zhang-Salomons JY, Groome PA, Mackillop WJ |title=Associations between community income and cancer survival in Ontario, Canada, and the United States |journal=Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=2244?55 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10561282 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10561282}}</ref>

Hsing et al. found that prostate cancer mortality incidence rate ratios were lower among U.S. whites than among any of the nationalities included in their study, including Canadians. U.S. African Americans in the study had lower rates than any group except for Canadians and U.S. whites.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hsing AW, Tsao L, Devesa SS |title=International trends and patterns of prostate cancer incidence and mortality |journal=International Journal of Cancer.

Among whites in the U.S., the death rate for prostate cancer remained constant, even though the incidence increased, so the additional reported prostate cancers did not represent an increase in real prostate cancers, said Hsing. Similarly, the death rates from prostate cancer in the U.S. increased during the 1980s and peaked in early 1990. This is at least partially due to "attribution bias" on death certificates, where doctors are more likely to ascribe a death to prostate cancer than to other diseases that affected the patient, because of greater awareness of prostate cancer or other reasons.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hsing AW, Devesa SS |title=Trends and patterns of prostate cancer: what do they suggest? |journal=Epidemiologic reviews |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=3?13 |year=2001 |pmid=11588851 |url=http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11588851}}</ref>

Because health status is "considerably affected" by socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, such as level of education and income, "the value of comparisons in isolating the impact of the health care system on outcomes is limited," according to health care analysts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Herzlinger RE, Parsa-Parsi R |title=Consumer-driven health care: lessons from Switzerland |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=292 |issue=10 |pages=1213?20 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15353534 |doi=10.1001/jama.292.10.1213 |url=}}</ref> Experts say that the incidence and mortality rates of cancer cannot be combined to calculate survival from cancer.<ref>Mooney, B.C.

===Racial and ethnic differences===
The U.S. and Canada differ substantially in their demographics, and these differences may contribute to differences in health outcomes between the two nations.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal |author=Singh GK, Yu SM |title=Infant mortality in the United States: trends, differentials, and projections, 1950 through 2010 |journal=American journal of public health |volume=85 |issue=7 |pages=957?64 |year=1995 |month=July |pmid=7604920 |pmc=1615523 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.85.7.957|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7604920}}</ref>  Although both countries have white majorities, Canada has a proportionately larger immigrant minority population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ |title=CIA ? The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>  Furthermore, the relative size of different ethnic and racial groups vary widely in each country.  [[Hispanics]] and peoples of African descent constitute a much larger proportion of the U.S. population.  Non-Hispanic [[First Nations|North American aboriginal]] peoples constitute a much larger proportion of the Canadian population{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}.  Canada also has a proportionally larger [[South Asian]] and [[East Asian]] population.  Also, the proportion of each population that is immigrant is higher in Canada.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

A study comparing aboriginal mortality rates in Canada, the U.S. and New Zealand found that aboriginals in all three countries had greater mortality rates and shorter life expectancies than the white majorities.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trovato F |title=Aboriginal mortality in Canada, the United States and New Zealand |journal=Journal of biosocial science |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=67?86 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11316396 |doi= 10.1017/S0021932001000670|url=}}</ref>  That study also found that aboriginals in Canada had both shorter life expectancies and greater infant mortality rates than aboriginals in the United States and New Zealand.  The health outcome differences between aboriginals and whites in Canada was also larger than in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Though few studies have been published concerning the health of [[Black Canadians]], health disparities between whites and African Americans in the U.S. have received intense scrutiny.<ref>Collins, C.A., Williams, D.R., Segregation and Mortality: The Deadly Effects of Racism? Sociological Forum, 14, 3, 1999</ref>  African Americans in the U.S. have significantly greater rates of cancer incidence and mortality.  Drs. Singh and Yu found that neonatal and postnatal mortality rates for American African Americans are more than double the non-Hispanic white rate.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  This difference persisted even after controlling for household income and was greatest in the highest income quintile.  A Canadian study also found differences in neonatal mortality between different racial and ethnic groups.<ref>Claydon, J.E., Mitton,, C., Sankaran, K., Lee, S. K., Canadian Neonatal Network, Ethnic Differences in Risk Factors for Neonatal Morality and Morbidity in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, J. Perin., 2007, 27, 448?452.</ref>  Although Canadians of African descent had a greater mortality rate than whites in that study, the rate was somewhat less than double the white rate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The racially heterogeneous Hispanic population in the U.S. has also been the subject of several studies.  Although members of this group are significantly more likely to live in poverty than are non-Hispanic whites, they often have disease rates that are comparable to or better than the non-Hispanic white majority.  Hispanics have lower cancer incidence and mortality, lower infant mortality, and lower rates of neural tube defects.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/uscs |title=U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=2010-08-20 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Feuchtbaum LB, Currier RJ, Riggle S, Roberson M, Lorey FW, Cunningham GC |title=Neural tube defect prevalence in California (1990?1994): eliciting patterns by type of defect and maternal race/ethnicity |journal=Genetic testing |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=265?72 |year=1999 |pmid=10495925 |doi=10.1089/109065799316572 |url=}}</ref> Singh and Yu found that infant mortality among Hispanic sub-groups varied with the racial composition of that group.  The mostly white Cuban population had a neonatal mortality rate (NMR)  nearly identical to that found in non-Hispanic whites and a postnatal mortality rate (PMR) that was somewhat lower.  The largely [[Mestizo]], Mexican, Central, and South American Hispanic populations had somewhat lower NMR and PMR.  [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Ricans]] who often have a mix of white and African ancestry had higher NMR and PMR rates.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Impact on economy==

In 2002, automotive companies claimed that the universal health care system in Canada saved labour costs.<ref>[http://www.house.gov/mcdermott/sp051215a.shtml U.S. Auto Industry Supports Universial Healthcare... in Canada.] House of Representatives ?

==Flexibility==
In Canada, increasing demands for health care, due to the [[population aging|aging population]], must be met by either increasing taxes or reducing other government programs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In the United States, under the current system, more of the burden for health care will be taken up by the private sector and individuals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Since 1998, Canada's successive multi-billion dollar budget surpluses have allowed a significant injection of new funding to the healthcare system, with the stated goal of reducing waiting times for treatment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  However, this may be hampered by the return to deficit spending as of the [[2009 Canadian federal budget]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

One historical problem with the U.S. system was known as [[job lock]], in which people become tied to their jobs for fear of losing their health insurance. This reduces the flexibility of the labor market.<ref>Blomqvist, ?ke. [http://www.cdhowe.org/pdf/benefactors_lecture_2002.pdf Canadian Health Care in a Global Context: Diagnoses and Prescriptions]. Toronto: C.D. Howe Institute, 2002. pg. 17</ref> Federal legislation passed since the mid-1980s, particularly  [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]] and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]], has been aimed at reducing job lock. However, providers of group health insurance in many states are permitted to use [[experience rating]] and it remains legal in the United States for prospective employers to investigate a job candidate's health and past health claims as part of a hiring decision{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. Someone who has recently been diagnosed with cancer, for example, may face [[job lock]] not out of fear of losing their health insurance, but based on prospective employers not wanting to add the cost of treating that illness to their own health insurance pool, for fear of future insurance rate increases. Thus, being diagnosed with an illness can cause someone to be forced to stay in their current job.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Politics of health==

===Politics of each country===
<!---needed a super-header here. the above may not be it  :)--->
More imaginative solutions in both countries have come from the sub-national level.

====Canada====
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
In Canada, the right-wing and now defunct [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] and its successor, the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] considered increasing the role of the private sector in the Canadian health care system.  Public backlash caused these plans to be abandoned, and the current majority Conservative government has re-affirmed its commitment to universal public medicine.

In Canada, it was [[Alberta]] under the Conservative government that has experimented most with increasing the role of the private sector in health care. Measures have included the introduction of private clinics that are allowed to bill patients for some of the cost of a procedure.

====United States====
In the U.S., President [[Bill Clinton]] attempted a [[Clinton health care plan|significant restructuring of health care]], but the effort collapsed under public pressure against it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  The [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. election]] saw [[prescription drug]]s become a central issue, although the system did not fundamentally change.  In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. election]] health care proved to be an important issue to some voters, though not a primary one.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 2006, [[Massachusetts]] adopted a [[Massachusetts 2006 Health Reform Statute|plan]] that vastly reduced the number of uninsured making it the state with the lowest percentage of non-insured residents in the union. It requires everyone to buy insurance and subsidizes insurance costs for lower income people on a sliding scale. Some{{Who|date=November 2010}} have claimed that the state's program is unaffordable, which the state itself says is "a commonly repeated myth".<ref>https://www.mahealthconnector.org/portal/binary/com.epicentric.contentmanagement.servlet.ContentDeliveryServlet/Health%2520Care%2520Reform/Overview/Connector%2520Progress%2520Report%252009.pdf</ref> In 2009, in a minor amendment, the plan did eliminate dental, hospice and skilled nursing care for certain categories of noncitizens covering 30,000 people (victims of human trafficking and domestic violence, applicants for asylum and refugees) who do pay taxes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/22/AR2009102204684.html |title=In Massachusetts, Obama won't promote state's health-care plan |author=Ceci Connolly |date=2009-10-23 |work= Washington Post |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/proposed_cuts_in_massachusetts.html |title=Proposed cuts in Massachusetts budget threatens health coverage for thousands under new insurance plan |publisher=masslive.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>

In July 2009, [[Connecticut]] passed into law a plan called [[SustiNet]], with the goal of achieving health-care coverage of 98% of its residents by 2014.<ref>[http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>

===Private care===
The Canada Health Act of 1984 "does not directly bar private delivery or private insurance for publicly insured services," but provides financial disincentives for doing so. "Although there are laws prohibiting or curtailing private health care in some provinces, they can be changed," according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Steinbrook R |title=Private health care in Canada |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=354 |issue=16 |pages=1661?4 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16625005 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp068064 |url=}}</ref> Governments attempt to control health care costs by being the sole purchasers and thus they do not allow private patients to bid up prices. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Those with non-emergency illnesses such as cancer cannot pay out of pocket for time-sensitive surgeries and must wait their turn on waiting lists. According to the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] in its 2005 ruling in ''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)|Chaoulli v. Quebec]]'', waiting list delays "increase the patient?s risk of mortality or the risk that his or her injuries will become irreparable."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2005/2005scc35/2005scc35.html |title=Chaoulli v.

===Consumer-driven health care===
In the United States, Congress has enacted laws to promote [[consumer-driven health care]] with [[health savings account]]s (HSAs), which were created by the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare bill]] signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] on December 8, 2003. HSAs are designed to provide [[tax incentives]] for individuals to save for future qualified medical and retiree health expenses.  Money placed in such accounts is tax-free, but funds in the account not used for health care by December 31 are kept by the bank.  They are not applied to the next year's health care or refunded to the person who earned the money.  To qualify for HSAs, individuals must carry a [[high-deductible health plan]] (HDHP). The higher [[deductible]] shifts some of the financial responsibility for health care from insurance providers to the consumer. This shift towards a market-based system with greater individual responsibility increased the differences between the US and Canadian systems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Some economists who have studied proposals for universal health care worry that the consumer driven healthcare movement will reduce the social redistributive effects of insurance that pools high-risk and low-risk people together. This concern was one of the driving factors behind a provision of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], informally known as ''Obamacare'', which limited the types of purchases which could be made with HSA funds. For example, as of January 1, 2011, these funds can no longer be used to buy [[over-the-counter drug]]s without a [[medical prescription]].<ref>{{Cite news| last=Gladwell| first=Malcolm | author-link=Malcolm Gladwell |date=2005-08-29 | title=The Moral Hazard Myth | periodical=[[The New Yorker]] | url=http://www.gladwell.com/2005/2005_08_29_a_hazard.html | accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref>
