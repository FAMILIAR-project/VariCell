== History ==

In socialist Yugoslavia, the official policy insisted on one language with two standard varieties?Eastern (used in Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina by all ethnicities, either with the Ekavian or the Ijekavian accent) and Western (used in Croatia by all ethnicities, the Ijekavian accent only). However, due to discontent in Croatian intellectual circles, beginning in the late 1960s Croatian cultural workers started to refer to the language exclusively as 'the Croatian literary language', or sometimes 'the Croatian or Serbian language', as was common before Yugoslavia. The language was regarded as one common language with different variants and dialects. The unity of the language was emphasized, making the differences not an indicator of linguistic divisions, but rather factors enriching the 'common language' diversity. In addition, Yugoslavia had two other official languages on the federal level, Slovenian and Macedonian, reflecting Yugoslavia's acceptance of diversity with regards to language use. No attempts were made to assimilate those languages into the Serbo-Croatian language.

With the breakup of the Federation, in search of additional indicators of independent and separate national identities, language became a political instrument in virtually all of the new republics. With a boom of neologisms in Croatia, an additional emphasis on Turkisms in the Muslim parts of Bosnia and a privileged position of the Cyrillic script in Serb inhabited parts of the new states, every state and entity showed a 'nationalization' of the language. The language in Bosnia started developing independently after [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] declared independence in 1992. The independent development of the language in Montenegro became a topic among some Montenegrin academics in the 1990s.

It should be noted that the Serbian and Bosnian language standards tend to be inclusive, i.e. to accept a wider range of idioms and to use loan-words, whereas the Croatian [[language policy]] is more purist<ref>{{cite journal |author= Kordi?, Snje?ana |authorlink=Snje?ana Kordi? |title=Purismo e censura linguistica in Croazia oggi |trans_title=Purism and censorship of language in Croatia nowadays |journal=Studi Slavistici |volume=5 |issue= |pages=281?297 |year=2008 |url=http://www.fupress.net/index.php/ss/article/view/2943/8774 |format= |doi= |language=Italian |issn=1824-761X |archivedate=8 August 2012  |deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69lPKIqUk |accessdate=9 August 2012 }}</ref> and prefers neologisms<ref>{{cite book |last=Kordi? |first=Snje?ana | authorlink=Snje?ana Kordi? |editor1-last=Symanzik |editor1-first=Bernhard |editor1-link= |title=Studia Philologica Slavica: Festschrift f?r Gerhard Birkfellner zum 65.

==Writing==
===Script===
*[[:File:Scripts in Europe (1901).jpg|Map of scripts in Europe 1901]]
*[[:File:Scripts in Europe.PNG|Map of scripts in Europe 2001]]
*[[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Gaj's Croatian Latin alphabet]]
Though all of the language variants could theoretically use either, the [[Writing system|scripts]] differ:
* Bosnian uses both Latin and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].
* Croatian uses strictly the [[Latin alphabet]].
* Standard Serbian language uses both Cyrillic (????????) and Latin script (latinica). Cyrillic is the official script of the administration in [[Serbia]] and [[Republika Srpska]] but Latin script is most widely used in everyday life.
* Montenegrin uses both Latin and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].

Historically, Croats used to use ''glagoljica'', the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] for writing both Croatian Church Slavonic and vernacular documents.

There was another, less standardized Cyrillic script. It had more versions and names: ''arvacko pismo'' or ''arvatica'', meaning the script used by Croats; this name was used in [[Povaljska listina]]; ''bosanica'' or ''[[bosan?ica]]'', meaning the script of the region of Bosnia; and ''begovica'' (used by [[bey]]s); ''polji?ica'', meaning from the Poljica region of southern Croatia. In some regions of Croatia, this script was used until the late 1860s, the Roman Catholic seminary in Omi? for example teaching new priests to use that script in writing ("arvacki ?eminarij") <!-- in recent monography Omi? and Poljica , I need to find the page number for correct reference -->.

Muslim populations in the areas of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Montenegro who converted to Islam after the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the 15th century, also once used a modified Arabic script known as [[Arebica]] (pronounced {{IPA-sh|arebitsa|}}). It was in use from the 15th to the early 20th century, primarily by the literate upper-class. The last known text published in Arebica was produced in 1941, after which the unification of [[Yugoslavia]] dictated that Cyrillic and Latin were the two official alphabets of all the Yugoslav Republics. It has all but fallen out of use as very few people are literate in Arebica today.

===Phonemes===

All standard languages have the same set of 30 regular [[phoneme]]s, so the Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian Latin and Serbian Cyrillic alphabets map one to one with one another, and with the phoneme inventory. 

Some linguists analyze the [[yat]] reflexes ?je? and ?ije?, commonly realized as {{IPA|[ie]}} in Croatian and Bosnian dialects, as a separate phoneme  ? "jat diphthong" ? or even two phonemes, one short and one long. There are even several proposals by Croatian linguists for an orthography reform concerning these two diphthongs, but they have not been seriously considered for implementation.

The ongoing standardization of [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] has introduced two new letters, ??? and ???, for the sounds {{IPA|[?]}} and {{IPA|[?]}} respectively. These are optional spellings of the digraphs ?sj? and ?zj?. Critics note that {{IPA|[?]}} and {{IPA|[?]}} are merely [[allophone]]s of {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/zj/}} in Herzegovinian dialects such as Montenegrin, so the new letters are not required for an adequate orthography

Most dialects of Serbia originally lack the phoneme {{IPA|/x/}}, instead having {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, or nothing  (silence). {{IPA|/x/}} was introduced with language unification, and the Serbian standard allows for some [[doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] such as ''snaja''?''snaha'' and ''hajde''?''ajde''. However, in other words, especially those of foreign origin, ?h? is mandatory.

In some regions of Croatia and Bosnia, sounds for letters ??? (realized as {{IPA|[t?]}} in most other dialects) and ??? {{IPA|[t?]}} [[merger (phonology)|merged]] or nearly merged, usually into {{IPA|[t?]}}. The same happened with their voiced counterparts, i.e. ?d?? and ??? merged into {{IPA|[d?]}}. As result, speakers of those dialects often have difficulties distinguishing the corresponding these sounds. However, this merger is nonstandard.

===Orthography===

The official language in Serbia alphabetically [[transliteration|transliterates]] foreign names (and sometimes words) even in children's books [but not from languages using a Cyrillic alphabet] whereas the Croatian standard allows both a transliteration and a phonetic [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Officially, the Bosnian language follows the Croatian example, but many books and newspapers phonetically transcribe foreign names.

Also, when the subject of the future tense is omitted, producing a reversal of the infinitive and auxiliary "?u", only the final "i" of the infinitive is elided in Croatian and Bosnian, whereas in Serbian the two have merged into a single word:

* "Uradit ?u to." (Croatian/Bosnian)
* "Uradi?u to." (Serbian)

Regardless of spelling, the pronunciation is roughly the same.

==Grammar==
===Accentuation===

In general, the [[Shtokavian dialect]]s that represent the foundation of the standard languages have four [[pitch accent]]s on stressed syllables: falling tone on a short vowel, written e.g. ?{{unicode|??}}? in dictionaries; rising tone on a short vowel, written e.g. ?{{unicode|?}}?; falling tone on a long vowel, written e.g. ?{{unicode|?}}?; and rising tone on a long vowel, written e.g. ?{{unicode|?}}?. In addition, the following unstressed vowel may be either short, ?{{unicode|i}}?, or long, ?{{unicode|?}}?. In [[declension]] and [[verb conjugation]], accent shifts, both by type and position, are very frequent.

The distinction between four accents and preservation of post accent lengths is common in vernaculars of western Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in parts of Serbia, as well as in parts of Croatia with strong Serb immigration. In addition, a distinct characteristics of some vernaculars is stress shift to [[proclitic]]s (e.g. phrase ''u Bosni'' (''in Bosnia'') will be pronounced {{IPA|/?bosni/}} instead of {{IPA|/ub?sni/}} as in northern parts of Serbia.

The northern vernaculars in Serbia also preserve the four-accent system, but the unstressed lengths have been shortened or disappeared in some positions. However, the shortening of post-accent lengths is in progress in all Shtokavian vernaculars, even in those most conservative in Montenegro. Stress shift to enclitics is, however, in northern Serbia rare and mostly limited to negative verb constructs (''ne znam'' = ''I don't know'' ? {{IPA|/n?zn?m/}}).

The situation in Croatia, is however, different. A large proportion of speakers of Croatian, especially those coming from [[Zagreb]], do not distinguish between rising and falling accents.<ref name="Brown">[http://seelrc.org:8080/grammar/mainframe.jsp?nLanguageID=1 A Handbook of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian, Wayles Brown and Theresa Alt, SEELRC 2004]</ref><ref name="Smiljanic">[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0505b&L=linguist&P=734 Lexical, Pragmatic, and Positional Effects on Prosody in Two Dialects of Croatian and Serbian, Rajka Smiljanic], Routledge, ISBN 0-415-97117-9</ref> This is considered to be a feature of the Zagreb dialect, which has strong Kajkavian influence, rather than standard Croatian.<ref name="Smiljanic"/>

In Croatian official linguistics, most of the literature in circulation promotes the four-accent system. Serbian standard language is based on four-accent-system that is common in most of Serbian vernaculars. Both dialects that are considered to be base of standard Serbian language (East-Herzegovinian and ?umadija-Vojvodina dialects) have four accents. Bosnian language is officially founded on East-Bosnian dialects{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}, which are of Old-Shtokavian type, but in practice the norm is Neo-Shtokavian accentuation just like in Croatian and Serbian.

===Morphology===

There are three principal [[Accent (dialect)|accents]] of the [[Shtokavian dialect|?tokavian dialect]] that differ in their reflexes of the proto-Slavic vowel [[Yat|jat]]. Illustrated by the [[Church Slavonic]] word for child, d'''?'''te, they are:

*d'''e'''te in the Ekavian accent
*d'''i'''te in the Ikavian accent
*d'''ije'''te in the Ijekavian accent

The Serbian language recognizes Ekavian and Ijekavian as equally prestigious accents, whereas Croatian and Bosnian accept only Ijekavian as such. In Bosnia and Herzegovina (regardless of the official language) and in Montenegro, the Ijekavian accent is used almost exclusively.

Ikavian accent is limited to dialectal use in Dalmatia, Lika, Istria, central Bosnia (area between [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] and [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]]), Western Herzegovina, [[Bosanska Krajina]], Slavonia and northern Ba?ka ([[Vojvodina]]). So, for example:

{|class = "wikitable"
! [[English language|English]] || Ekavian || Ijekavian || Ikavian
|-
| wind || v'''e'''tar || v'''je'''tar || v'''i'''tar
|-
| milk || ml'''e'''ko || ml'''ije'''ko || ml'''i'''ko

|-
| colspan="4" | '''But:'''
|- valign="top"
| small arrow || str'''e'''lica || str'''e'''lica || str'''i'''lica
|}

A few Croatian linguists have tried to explain the following differences in morphological structure for some words, with the introduction of a new vowel, "jat diphthong". This is not the opinion of most linguists.

Sometimes this leads to confusion: Serbian pot'''i'''cati (to stem from) is in Croatian and Bosnian "to encourage". Croatian and Bosnian "to stem from" is pot'''je'''cati, whereas Serbian for "encourage" is po'''dsti'''cati.

{|class = "wikitable"

|-

| gulf, bay      || zal'''je'''v         || zal'''i'''v
|-
| to influence   || ut'''je'''cati       || ut'''i'''cati
|}

The Bosnian official language allows both variants, and ambiguities are resolved with preference to the Croatian variant; this is a general practice for Serbian-Croatian ambiguities.

Another example for phonetical differences is words which have '''h''' in Croatian and Bosnian, but '''v''' in Serbian:

{|class = "wikitable"
! English || Serbian || Bosnian and Croatian
|-
| tobacco || duvan   || duhan
|-
| to cook || kuvati  || kuhati
|-
| dry || suvo  || suho
|-
| deaf|| gluvo  || gluho
|}

Phonetically and phonologically, the phoneme "h" is reinstated in many words as a distinct feature of Bosnian speech and language tradition; some Bosniaks prefer not to use the Serbian terminology. However, there are many people who do not speak this way. It is a regional or colloquial way of speaking.

{|class = "wikitable"
! English || Bosnian || Croatian || Serbian
|-
| easy || lahko  || lako || lako
|-
| soft || mehko  || meko || meko
|-

|}

As the Ijekavian accent is common to all official standards, it will be used for examples on this page. Other than this, examples of different morphology are:

===Internationalisms===

Also many [[internationalism (linguistics)|internationalism]]s and transliterations are different:

{|class = "wikitable"

|-
| to construct || konstruirati<br>konstruisati || konstruirati || konstruisati
|-
| colspan="4" | '''But:'''
|-
| to analyse || analizirati || analizirati || analizirati
|}

Historically, modern-age internationalisms entered Bosnian and Croatian mostly through German and Italian, whereas they entered Serbian through French and Russian, so different localization patterns were established based on those languages. Also, Greek borrowings came to Serbian directly, but through Latin into Croatian:

{|class = "wikitable"
! English || Bosnian || Croatian || Serbian || Note
|-
| [[Bethlehem]] || Betlehem || Betlehem || Vitlejem ||rowspan=5| Through Latin in Croatian, through Greek in Serbian

|-
| colspan="5" | '''But:'''
|-
| license || licenca || licenca || licenca || rowspan=2|Through Latin in both
|-
| tendency || tendencija || tendencija || tendencija 
|}

Most of terms for [[chemical element]]s are different: for international names, Bosnian and Croatian use ''-ij'' where Serbian has ''-ijum'' (''uranij''?''uranijum''). In some native names, Croatian have ''-ik'' where Serbian has -(o)nik (''kisik''?''kiseonik'' 'oxygen', ''vodik''?''vodonik'' 'hydrogen') and Bosnian accepts all variants. Yet others are totally different (''du?ik''?''azot'' 'nitrogen', ''kositar''?''kalaj'' 'tin'). Some element names are the same: ''srebro'' (silver), ''zlato'' (gold), ''bakar'' (copper).

Some other imported words differ by [[grammatical gender]], feminine words having an ''-a'' suffix and masculine words having a zero-suffix:

{|class = "wikitable"
! English || Serbian || Croatian
|-
| minute (n.) || minut/minuta               || minuta
|-
| second (n.) || sekund/sekunda        || sekunda
|-
| colspan="4" | '''But:'''
|-
| planet  || planeta             || planet

|-
| territory  || teritorija             || teritorij
|-
| mystery  || misterija             || misterij
|}

===Pronouns===
In Serbian and Bosnian, the [[pronoun]] ''what'' is ''?to'' when used as a [[relative pronoun|relative]], but ''?ta'' when used as an [[interrogative pronoun|interrogative]]; the latter applies also to relative sentences with interrogative meaning. Croatian uses ''?to'' in all contexts.

{|class = "wikitable"
! English || Bosnian and Serbian || Croatian and Montenegrin
|-
| What did he say?|| '''?ta''' je rekao?|| '''?to''' je rekao?
|-
| Ask him what he said.||Pitaj ga '''?ta''' je rekao.|| Pitaj ga '''?to''' je rekao.
|-
| What he said was a lie.||To '''?to''' je rekao je la?.|| To '''?to''' je rekao je la?.
|}

This is applicable only to the [[nominative case|nominative]] and the [[accusative case|accusative]] ? in all other cases, the standards have the same forms: ''?ega'', ''?emu'' etc. for ''?to''.

In Croatian, the pronoun ''who'' has the form ''tko'', whereas in Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin it has ''ko''. The declension is the same: ''kome'', ''koga'', etc. In addition, Croatian uses ''komu'' as an alternative form in the [[dative case]].

Usage of locative pronouns ''gd(j)e'', ''kuda'', and ''kamo'' differs between Serbian and Croatian (the latter not being used in Serbian): 

{|class = "wikitable"
! English || Bosnian and Serbian (Ijekavian) || Croatian || Montenegrin
|-
| Where will you be?|| '''Gdje''' ?e? biti?|| '''Gdje''' ?e? biti? || '''?e''' ?e? biti?
|-
| Where will you go?||'''Gdje''' ?e? i?i??<br>('''Kuda''' ?e? i?i?)||'''Kamo''' ?e? i?i? || '''?e''' ?e? i?i?
|-
| Which way will you go?||'''Kuda''' ?e? i?i?||'''Kuda''' ?e? i?i? || '''Kuda''' ?e? i?i?
|}

===Syntax===
====Infinitive vs. subjunctive====

With modal verbs such as ''ht(j)eti'' (want) or ''mo?i'' (can), the [[infinitive]] is [[Prescription and description|prescribed]] in Croatian, whereas the construction ''da'' (that/to) + present tense is preferred in Serbian. This is a remnant of [[subjunctive]], and possibly an influence of the [[Balkan sprachbund]]. Again, both alternatives are present and allowed in Bosnian (the first one is preferred in orthography, the latter is more common in colloquial language).

<!-- The difference between the reflections of yat is explained above, so here I chose an example that is the same in everything but the syntax. /Duja -->
The sentence "I want to do that" could be translated with any of
* ''Ho?u to da uradim.''
* ''Ho?u to uraditi.''

This difference partly extends to the future tense, which in Serbo-Croatian is formed in a similar manner to English, using (elided) present of verb "ht(j)eti" -> "ho?u"/"ho?e?"/... -> "?u"/"?e?"/... as auxiliary verb. Here, the infinitive is formally required in both variants:

* ''Ja ?u to uraditi.'' (I shall do that.)

However, when ''da''+present is used instead, in it can additionally express the subject's will or intention to perform the action:

* ''Ja ?u to da uradim.'' (I '''will''' do that.)

This form is more frequently used in Serbia and Bosnia. The nuances in meaning between two constructs can be slight or even lost (especially in Serbian dialects), in similar manner as the ''shall/will'' distinction varies across English dialects. Overuse of ''da''+present is regarded as Germanism in Serbian linguistic circles, and it can occasionally lead to awkward sentences.

However, Croatians seldom naturally use ''da''+present form. Instead, a different form can be used to express will:

* ''Ja ho?u to uraditi.'' (I want to do that.)
The sentence would sound more Croatian, but keep the same meaning, if it stated: "?elim to u?initi.", as "uraditi" is uncommon in Croatian.

====Interrogative constructs====

In interrogative and relative constructs, Croatian uses the interrogative participle ''li'' after the verb, whereas Serbian also allows forms with ''da li''. (A similar situation exists in French, where a question can be formed either by inversion or using ''est-ce que'', and can be stretched in English with modal verbs):

* ''Mo?e? li?'' (Can you?) (spoken Croatian)
* Both ''Mo?e? li?'' and ''Da li mo?e??'' (Can you, Do you can?) are common in Serbian.

In addition, non-grammatical ''je li'' ("Is it?"), usually elided to ''je l' '', is vernacular for forming all kinds of questions, e.g. ''Je l' mo?e??''. In standard language, it is used only in questions involving auxiliary verb ''je'' (="is"):

* ''Je li mogu?e?'' (Is it possible?) (spoken Croatian)
* Both ''Je li mogu?e?'' and ''Da li je mogu?e?'' are common in Serbian.

In summary, the English sentence "I want to know whether I'll start working" would ''typically'' read:

* ''''?elim da znam ho?u li po?eti da radim.'' (spoken Serbian)
* ''?elim znati ho?u li po?eti raditi.'' (spoken Croatian)

although many in-between combinations could be met in vernacular speech, depending on speaker's dialect, idiolect, or even mood.

====Trebati (need)====
In formal Croatian, verb ''trebati'' (''need'' or ''should'') is [[transitive verb|transitive]], as in English.<ref name=hjp_trebati>{{cite web|url=http://hjp.srce.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&id=f19kXhJ9&keyword=trebati |title=Trebati |publisher=Hrvatski jezi?ni portal |language=Croatian}}</ref> In Serbian and Bosnian, it is [[impersonal verb|impersonal]], (as French ''il faut'', or English construct ''is necessary (to)''); the grammatical subject is either omitted (''it''), or presents the '''object''' of needing; the person that needs something is an indirect grammatical object, in [[dative case]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.rastko.rs/filologija/odbor/odluka012.html#_Toc33157657 |title=Kartoteka jezi?kih nedoumica |publisher=Odbor za standardizaciju srpskog jezika |chapter=VI.Sintaksa ?4 |language=Serbian}}</ref> (Such usage is, however, also encountered in Croatian, especially spoken.<ref name=hjp_trebati/>):

===Vocabulary===
====Examples====
{{See also|Croatian linguistic purism}}
The greatest differences between the standards is in [[vocabulary]]. However, most words are well understood, and even occasionally used, in the other standards. In most cases, common usage favors one variant and the other(s) are regarded as "imported", archaic, dialectal, or simply more rarely used. The preference for certain words depends on the speaker's geographic origin rather than ethnicity; for example, Serbs from Bosnia use "mrkva" and "hla?e" rather than "?argarepa" and "pantalone".

Note that there are only a few differences that can cause confusion, for example the verb "li?iti" means "to look like" in Serbian and Bosnian, but in Croatian it is "sli?iti"; "li?iti" means "to paint (a house)".

The word "bilo" means "white" in the Ikavian accent, "pulse" in official Croatian, and "was" in all official languages, although it is not so confusing when pronounced because of different [[Serbo-Croatian language#Stress|accentuation]] (''b?lo'' or ''b?lo'' = white, ''b??lo'' = pulse, ''b?lo'' = was).

In Serbian and Bosnian, the word ''izvanredan'' (extraordinary) has only the positive meaning (excellent), ''vanredan'' being used for "unusual" or "out of order"; however, only ''izvanredan'' is used in Croatian in both contexts. Thus, Croatian phrase ''izvanredno stanje'' ([[martial law]]) sounds funny to Serbian ears (Croatians would more naturally use 'izvrsno' (can be used in Serbian and Bosnian too) for excellent).

Also note that in most cases Bosnian officially allows almost all of the listed variants in the name of "language richness", and ambiguities are resolved by preferring the Croatian variant. Bosnian vocabulary writers based their decisions on usage of certain words in literary works by Bosnian authors.

====Names of the months====

The months have Slavic-derived names in Croatian, wheres Serbian and Bosnian have the same set of international [[Latin]]-derived names as English. The Slavic-derived names may also be used in Bosnian, but the [[Latin]]-derived names are preferred.

International names of months are well understood in Croatia and several names of internationally important events are commonly known using the international name of the month: "1. maj", "1. april", "oktobarska revolucija".
In spoken Croatian and Bosnian in western Bosnia (Bosanska Krajina) it is common to refer to a month by its number. Therefore many speakers of Croatian and Bosnian often say "peti mjesec" ("the fifth month").

==Notes on comprehension==

It is important to notice a few issues:

* Pronunciation and vocabulary differs among dialects spoken '''within''' Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia themselves. Each larger region has its own pronunciation and it is reasonably easy to guess where a speaker is from by their accent and/or vocabulary. [[Colloquial]] vocabulary can be particularly different from the official standards.<br>This is one of the arguments for claiming it is all one and the same language: there are more differences ''within'' the territories of the official languages themselves than there are ''between'' the standards (all three of which are based on the same Neo-?tokavian dialect). This is not surprising, of course, for if the lines between the varieties were drawn not politically but linguistically, then there would be no borders at all.  As [[Pavle Ivi?]] explains, the continuous migration of Slavic populations during the five hundred years of Turkish rule has scattered the local dialects all around.
* When Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs talk amongst each other, the other speakers usually understand them completely, save for the odd word, and quite often, they will know what that means (much as with British and American English speakers). Nevertheless, when communicating with each other, there is a habit to use terms that are familiar to everyone, with the intent to avoid not being understood and/or confusion. For example, to avoid confusion with the names of the months, they can be referred to as the "first month", "second month" and so on, or the Latin-derived names can be used if "first month" itself is ambiguous, which makes it perfectly understandable for everyone. In Serbia, the names of the months are the international ones so again they are understandable for anyone who knows English or another Western European language.
* Even during the time of Yugoslavia it was common for publishers to do some adaptations to "Eastern" or "Western" standard. Especially translations were and are changed by the lectors. It is to be considered that Croatian and Serbian standards have completely different scientific terminology{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. [[Jung's]] masterpiece "Psychology and Alchemy" was translated into Croatian in 1986, and adapted in late 1990s into Serbian. [[Ivo Andri?]] had some problems in Croatia with publishers who changed his infinitive constructions and other expressions. Eventually, he managed to forbid that kind of intervention. In Montenegro, the publisher CID switched from the Ekavian to the Jekavian accent after Montenegro's independence.
