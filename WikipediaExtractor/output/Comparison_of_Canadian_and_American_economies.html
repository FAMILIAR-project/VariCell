   <h1 class="article-heading">Comparison of Canadian and American economies</h1> 
   <div class="article-content"> 
    <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{Time-context|...}}</span> The <b>economies of <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and the <a href="United States">United States</a></b> are similar because they are both <a href="developed countries">developed countries</a> and are each other's largest trading partners. However, key differences in population makeup, geography, government policies and productivity all result in different economies. </p> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2>Government</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <div class="section"> 
       <h3>Taxation</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{main|...}}</span><span class="unknown-node">{{Disputed section|...}}</span> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> In Canada total tax and <a href="non-tax revenue">non-tax revenue</a> for every level of government equals about 38.4% of GDP,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> compared to the U.S. rate of 28.2%.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> A significant portion of this tax differential is due to spending differences between the two countries. While the US is running deficits of about 4% of GDP,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Canada's Federal government posted a budget surplus of around 1% of GDP per year from the mid-1990s until 2008, and is projected to enter back into a surplus by 2016.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The deficit patterns and indebtedness of Canada's individual provinces vary like they do in the US among different states. Considered in a revenue-neutral context, the differential is much smaller - Canada's total governmental spending was about 36% of GDP<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> vs. 31% in the US.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> In addition, caution must be used when comparing taxes across countries, due to the different services each offers. Whereas the Canadian healthcare system is 70% government-funded, the US system is just under 50% government-funded (mostly via <a href="Medicare (United States)">Medicare</a> and <a href="Medicaid">Medicaid</a>); adding the additional healthcare-spending burden to the above figures to obtain comparable numbers (+3% for Canada, +7% for the US) gives adjusted expenditures of 38?39% of GDP for each of the two nations. </p> 
        <p> The taxes are applied the same as well. Canada's income tax system is more heavily biased against the highest income earners, thus while Canada's income tax rate is higher on average<span class="unknown-node">{{Citation needed|...}}</span>, the bottom fifty percent of the population is roughly taxed the same on income as in the United States. However, Canada has a national <a href="Goods and Services Tax (Canada)">goods and services tax</a> of 5% on most purchases, while the U.S. federal government does not, increasing the tax burden on Canadian low-income earners due to the <a href="Proportional tax">proportional</a> nature of a sales tax. Canadian GST does not tax food and other essentials and a GST rebate for low-income earners mitigates regressiveness.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> In addition to the 5% GST levied on most purchases, some Canadians also pay a provincial sales tax at a rate that varies by province and can be as high as 10%. In Ontario, for example, where the provincial sales tax (PST) is 8%, consumers must pay a total of 13% sales tax on top of the purchase price. (It should be noted that Ontario has eliminated both the PST and GST, replacing them with harmonized sales tax, or HST, of 13%, which changes the sales tax on some items.) There are some purchases which are PST exempt, such as children's clothing. In the U.S., most states impose a sales tax, and cities and counties are often permitted to levy taxes as well, which can exceed 10% on purchases but realistically average at about 6-8%. Five U.S. states do not have any sales tax imposed.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The Canadian province of Alberta and all three territories have no provincial or territorial sales tax on top of the GST. </p>

      <div class="section"> 
       <h3>Government Spending</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> Government spending at all levels (federal, state/provincial and local) has traditionally been higher in Canada than the United States. In Canada, government spending as a percentage of <a href="GDP">GDP</a> peaked at 53% in 1992. Since 1992 spending has steadily declined in Canada to just below 40 percent in 2008.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> Spending in the United States fluctuated narrowly around 34-38 percent of GDP over the same period.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> However, starting in 2008 US spending has turned sharply upwards to reach an estimated 42.7% of GDP in 2009<span class="unknown-node">{{Update after|...}}</span> <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> from 39% in 2008. Spending is expected to reach 45% of GDP in 2011 <span class="unknown-node">{{Update after|...}}</span>,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> and stabilize at that level.<span class="unknown-node">{{Citation needed|...}}</span> </p> 
       </div> 
      </div> 
      <div class="section"> 
       <h3>Social programs</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{See also|...}}</span> </p> 
        <p> For its higher taxes Canada has a larger system of <a href="social program">social programs</a> than the United States. This includes having a national broadcaster in the <a href="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation">CBC</a>, a largely government-funded <a href="health care">health care</a> system, and having all major <a href="universities">universities</a> receive partial government funding. The United States, however, does have most of its major universities subsidized by <a href="U.S. state">state</a> government. The US also has two national public broadcasters which receive partial government funding, <a href="Public Broadcasting Service">PBS</a> (television) and <a href="National Public Radio">NPR</a> (radio). </p> 
        <p> The greatest difference in social programs is in health care. Contrary to popular belief, the U.S. Government spends as much on health care, 7% of GDP, as the Canadian government does,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> and total healthcare spending is much higher - 14.6% of GDP in the US vs. 10% in Canada.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Canadians, however, receive comparable care to those Americans who receive treatment, and result measures. The Canadian health care system is said by some also to be attractive to employers, as in Canada health care is mostly paid through employee income taxes, while in the United States most companies choose to extend <a href="Health benefits (insurance)">health benefits</a> to full-time employees. Many employers in Canada do offer employees some additional medical coverage, for non-necessary treatments, and for pharmaceuticals which are not universally covered by the government-paid health insurance system. The most common complaint regarding the Canadian system are the long lines and waiting periods that have appeared for minor and non-life threatening procedures over the last 15 years, since the introduction of widespread cuts to public funding. Separately, a number of medical tests and screenings are not covered (or due to increasing costs, are no longer covered) by the Canadian health system, forcing patients to pay for these services out of their own pockets. For these reasons, some relatively wealthy Canadians undergo treatment at private healthcare facilities at their own expense, either in Canada, in India, or in other nations<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> to avoid waiting for medical treatment, joining &quot;<a href="medical tourism">medical tourists</a>&quot; from many nations, including the US.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Despite these sporadic problems, Canada's healthcare performance is generally on par with the US.<span class="unknown-node">{{Citation needed|...}}</span> Efforts were made to reduce wait times by many provincial governments in the 1990s and 2000s, in an effort to improve care. Furthermore, healthcare coverage is universal for Canadians, and transferable outside a home province within Canada. </p>

       <h3>Anti-trust</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{main|...}}</span> </p> 
        <p> The United States has since the <a href="Sherman Anti-Trust Act">Sherman Anti-Trust Act</a> been strongly opposed to <a href="monopolies">monopolies</a>. In Canada this has been far less of an issue, and Canada has never had rigorously enforced rules against monopolization, and in certain situations the government has even encouraged monopolies. However, the Canadian government is more willing to interfere in the operations of large, integrated firms where they appear to be acting against the public interest, offsetting in part one reason that American law prevents large-scale monopolization. Historical transport policy led to the promotion of one railway operator &amp; one dominant flag carrier and the promotion of bus carriers through the suppression of other bus-like services. In telecommunications policy, oligopoly conditions are reinforced through the actions of the Canada Radio and Telecommunications (CRTC). Foreign ownership has been banned in Canada's cell phone market (Though one Egyptian-owned entrant, Windmobile has led to a possibility of a liberalization of telecommunications) Banking policy has been regulated through Bank Acts passed by Parliament. </p>

      <div class="section"> 
       <h3>Fiscal and monetary policy</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{see also|...}}</span> Canada is generally forced to follow American <a href="monetary policy">monetary policy</a> quite closely, any large difference in <a href="interest rate">interest rates</a> could quickly lead to large problems for the Canadian economy. The U.S. <a href="Federal Reserve">Federal Reserve</a> and the <a href="Bank of Canada">Bank of Canada</a> both staunchly believe in fighting <a href="inflation">inflation</a> while neither aggressively pursue policies of <a href="full employment">full employment</a>. One difference that has emerged recently is that while Canada is still hewing closely to the <a href="budget">balanced budgets</a> policies of the 1990s the United States has moved into a heavy <a href="Government budget deficit">deficit</a>, a policy both countries followed in the 1970s and 1980s. </p> 
       </div> 
      </div> 
     </div> 
    </div> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2>Market size</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> One of the most important differences historically between Canada and the United States was the size of the two markets. When both nations had high tariffs the two countries did not have a unified market. Canada's smaller market led to higher prices and greater inefficiency. </p> 
      <p> A good example of this is the automobile industry, which can be clearly demarcated into two periods: before and after the free trade creating <a href="Auto Pact">Auto Pact</a> of 1969. Before this, Canada had its own production lines creating each of the models that would be sold in Canada. These <a href="branch plant">branch plant</a> factories would only make small production runs of each vehicle, requiring frequent, and expensive retoolings. The factories would also generally be smaller. Fewer varieties were available to Canadian consumers and prices were generally higher. However, these cars were almost all still made by American companies. After the Auto Pact, the industry was transformed as a unified North American market was created. The Canadian factories were rebuilt to be much larger, but to make only one model that would be sold in both countries creating large <a href="economies of scale">economies of scale</a>. The prices of cars fell in Canada as wages and total employment in the automobile sector increased. </p> 
      <p> After the <a href="Second World War">Second World War</a> tariffs between the two countries gradually fell, with full <a href="free trade">free trade</a> being established by the 1988 <a href="Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement">Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement</a>. Some industries are still protected, however. These are mostly perceived as sensitive areas such as cultural industries including publishing, television, and newspapers, all of which have stringent foreign ownership rules. Other areas such as the transport industry are also protected with Canadian control of the airlines and trains being viewed as in the national interest. </p> 
      <p> This tends to create far more monopolies in Canada. For instance the air travel industry in Canada until recently was dominated by a single airline, <a href="Air Canada">Air Canada</a>. Canada has long had to make a trade-off between monopolization and efficiency which the United States has not. The United States can support a number of airlines that are big enough to operate efficiently, and still have a competitive market (although in recent years the competitiveness of the major US airlines declined sharply). Canadians are forced to choose between small inefficient airlines that would be competitive, or monopolistic airlines that will generate their own inefficiency. </p>

     <h2>Banking</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{Unreferenced section|...}}</span> <span class="unknown-node">{{Out of date|...}}</span> <a href="Banking in Canada">Canada</a> and the <a href="Banking in the United States">United States</a> have long had very different <a href="Bank">banking</a> systems. The United States' was copied from <a href="England">England</a>, while Canada's was taken from <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The United States traditionally has had a plethora of banks, some with very few branches. The U.S. system continues to support the creation of numerous small banks through both government-sponsored institutions like the <a href="Federal Home Loan Banks">Federal Home Loan Banks</a> and similar non-government entities like <a href="Bankers' bank">Bankers' bank</a>, that does not exist in markets like Canada. This has led to a more competitive but less stable system, with many thousands of banks having collapsed during <a href="History of banking in the United States">U.S. history</a>. The <a href="Glass?Steagall Act">Glass?Steagall Act</a> and other laws and regulations prevented U.S. banks from growing beyond certain limits. Changes allowed U.S. banks to grow and the <a href="Glass?Steagall Act">Glass?Steagall Act</a> was repealed in 1999. Canada has always had far fewer banks per capita, but the banks have been larger and quickly expanded nationwide. <a href="Big Five (banks)">Canadian banks</a> have many branches and distributed assets. Canada has only had one major bank, the <a href="Home Bank">Home Bank</a>, collapse in its history. This concentration of banks in Canada relative to the U.S. has continued to this day. In 2002, Canada's the six largest banks controlled 90 percent of Canadian domestic banking assets, while the five largest U.S. banks controlled only 9.7 percent of their domestic assets. </p> 
      <p> There are several subsidies in the U.S. system that do not exist in Canada. In terms of direct impact to consumers, mortgage interest is a tax deductible in the U.S. (a <a href="market distortion">market distortion</a> designed to encourage home ownership), but is not in Canada. The U.S. also indirectly subsidizes mortgages through a plethora of <a href="government sponsored enterprise">government sponsored enterprises</a>. The U.S. entities do much more than provide <a href="mortgage insurance">mortgage insurance</a>, and use their own huge balance sheets to purchase mortgages. The <a href="Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation">Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation</a> historically was mainly limited to providing mortgage insurance, although now facilitates funding of mortgages also through the <a href="Canada Mortgage Bond">Canada Mortgage Bond</a> program, which has also grown to be quite large. </p> 
      <p> <a href="Big Five (banks)">Canada's banks</a> have traditionally been fierce competitors internationally, while America's largest banks have had a more significant presence overseas. In part, the history of this situation is rooted in Canada's smaller market. For Canadian banks, international exchange was always a central concern. For American banks, domestic banking was paramount. In the 1920s, Canadian banks dominated the international banking sector due to greater expertise and focus in the American economic centre of <a href="New York">New York</a>. Thus Canadian banks came to have a wider spread networks. Much of the banking system in the <a href="West Indies">West Indies</a> is controlled by the Canadian banks. Canadian banks also have far more of a presence in the United States than American firms do in Canada. In part, this is because American firms cannot buy Canadian banks, but Canadian banks have, at times, been able to buy American ones. Since the large Canadian banks already operated nationwide chains of a thousand or more branches, they find it relatively easy to integrate smaller chains of American banks into their systems. </p> 
      <p> In recent years this advantage has disappeared as American banks have also grown substantially in size and today have many branches, and the large American banks are now operating over 2000 branches each. In fact, the ten largest banks in North America today are all U.S.-based. Overseas, American banks have a larger presence than Canadian banks. Only <a href="Royal Bank of Canada">Royal Bank of Canada</a>'s <a href="RBC Capital Markets">RBC Capital Markets</a> division has a global scale that even approaches that of the U.S. investment banks. </p> 
      <p> Until recently, Canadian banks had historically been far less strictly regulated than their American counterparts. Canadian banks had, until the <a href="Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a> in 1999, been freer to participate in the financial planning and insurance industries than their American counterparts. In the 1980s and 1990s, the large Canadian banks acquired almost all significant trust and brokerage companies in Canada. They also started their own mutual fund and insurance businesses. As a result, Canadian banks broadened out to become supermarkets of financial services, a trend that started later in the U.S. market. The average U.S. bank is a domestic banking operation. The large Canadian banks are financial conglomerates, with large domestic Canadian banking operations. </p> 
      <p> Bank regulation in the United States is highly fragmented compared to Canada which has only <a href="OSFI">OSFI</a> as the bank regulator (although <a href="credit unions">credit unions</a> are provincially regulated). In the U.S., a bank's primary regulator could be the <a href="Federal Reserve Board">Federal Reserve Board</a>, the <a href="Office of the Comptroller of the Currency">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</a>, the <a href="Office of Thrift Supervision">Office of Thrift Supervision</a>, or any one of 50 state regulatory bodies, depending on the charter of the bank. And within the Federal Reserve Board, there are 12 districts with 12 different regulatory staffing groups. The U.S. is also one of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not safety and soundness related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-<a href="usury">usury</a> lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments. Even individual cities enact their own financial regulation laws (for example, for <a href="usury">usury</a> lending). Canadian banks have not faced laws against <a href="usury">usury</a>, or interest guarantees on deposits. <a href="Return on equity">Return on equity</a> for Canadian banks were generally comparable to U.S. banks (with <a href="return on assets">return on assets</a> lower, but with Canadian banks using more leverage to compensate). </p> 
      <p> Credit unions in Canada are tax-paying entities, while they have been tax-exempt in the U.S. However, as restrictions on the size of credit unions in the U.S. have eased, the <a href="American Bankers Association">American Bankers Association</a> has lobbied to have credit unions taxed to level the playing field. </p>

     <h2>Prices</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> In Canada prices have long tended to be higher. This is partly because of structural issues in Canada such as low population density<span class="unknown-node">{{Dubious|...}}</span> and harsher weather<span class="unknown-node">{{Dubious|...}}</span>, and partly due to Canada's tax system, which depends more heavily on sales taxes relative to income taxes than the US. This has contributed to phenomena such as <a href="cross-border shopping">cross-border shopping</a>. Since the early 1990s this has not been the case<span class="unknown-node">{{Whom?|...}}</span>, as the <a href="Canadian dollar">Canadian dollar</a> had fallen low enough<span class="unknown-node">{{Vague|...}}</span> that it more than made up for price differences<span class="unknown-node">{{Dubious|...}}</span>. Today prices are somewhat lower in Canada for at least one item: the <a href="Big Mac Index">Big Mac Index</a> shows that in January 2006 a <a href="Big Mac">Big Mac</a> cost $3.15 in the States and only $3.01 in Canada <a href="http://www.economist.com/markets/bigmac/displayStory.cfm?story_id=5389856">1</a> (both figures in <a href="USD">USD</a>). In October, 2007 a strong Canadian dollar rose to parity with a weak American dollar, benefiting Canadian travelers and consumers. However, this was not favorable to Canadian manufacturers and exporters who do most of their business south of the border. As the economic conditions decayed in 2008, a flight to safety in the American dollar and lower prices<span class="unknown-node">{{Quantify|...}}</span> for Canadian commodities<span class="unknown-node">{{Which|...}}</span> reversed some of the growth in the Canadian dollar relative to the American dollar. </p> 
      <p> <a href="Fuel">Fuel</a> prices have always been higher in Canada, even though Canada is a net exporter of energy. This is because Canada, unlike many oil producers, does not heavily subsidize fuel. Prices are based on the world market price. </p>

     <h2>Productivity</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> Canadian workers are estimated to be 82% as productive per hour as their American counterparts.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The industries with the largest productivity advantages for the U.S. are the <a href="manufacturing">manufacturing</a> (particularly <a href="electronics">electronics</a> and <a href="computer">computer</a>), <a href="finance">finance</a>, and <a href="Service Sector">service</a> sectors. Industries where Canada is more productive than the U.S. are the <a href="construction">construction</a> and <a href="natural resources">natural resources</a> sectors with Canadian workers achieving 129% relative productivity.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> The productivity gap had been even larger in the 1950s but the difference has been narrowing, aided by the elimination of the smaller market problem through free trade. The gap was still closing somewhat in the 1980s but at a much slower pace than in the 1960s. From 1961 to 1973 labour productivity rose annually by 3.3 percent in Canada and 1.7 percent in the United States. From 1973 to 1995 productivity growth was 1.1% in Canada and 0.8% in the United States.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> The productivity gap began to widen again in the 1990s, particularly in the manufacturing sector. By 2000, this was called Canada's &quot;Excellence Gap&quot; by the Chief Economist of Canadian Manufacturers &amp; Exporters.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The United States has the second-highest productivity of the <a href="G8">G8</a> countries,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> while Canada's is 5th based on the 1997 estimate.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> Five main reasons for the productivity gap: the lower capital intensity of economic activity in Canada; an innovation gap in Canada relative to the United States; Canada's relatively underdeveloped high-tech sector; less developed human capital in Canada in terms of proportionately fewer university graduates and scientists and engineers in research and development; and more limited economies of scale and scope in Canada. </p>

     <h2>Organized Labour</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> Both Canada and the U.S. follow the <a href="National Labor Relations Act">Wagoner Act</a> model of regulating trade unions and collective bargaining, though legislation regulating organized labor principally falls under provincial jurisdiction in Canada. That North American model differs significantly from patterns of organized labor found in other developed countries. </p>

     <h2>Unemployment</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> For several decades Canada typically had reported its <a href="unemployment rate">unemployment rate</a> as somewhat higher than the US rate. For example, in June 2008 the reported unemployment in the US was 5.5 percent and 6.1% in Canada. However, a closer examination reveals that the two countries measure the unemployment rate differently. <a href="Craig Riddell">Craig Riddell</a>, a <a href="University of British Columbia">University of British Columbia</a> economist, found that a 0.9% difference was caused by the differing measurement systems.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Statistics Canada has also acknowledged this, and it now publishes a second unemployment rate using the same methodology as the Americans. Using the American methodology, the June 2008 Canadian unemployment rate was 5.3%, which was 0.2% lower than the American rate.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> Prior to the identification of the difference in methodologies, some politicians claimed that higher income taxes, restrictive labour laws, unions, universal healthcare, and greater unemployment benefits in Canada were causing a higher <i>actual</i> unemployment rate. However, when <a href="unemployment insurance">unemployment insurance</a> and <a href="Welfare (financial aid)">welfare</a> were sharply cut in many parts of Canada during the 1990s there was little gain in employment relative to the Americans. Others attempted to explain the reported difference in terms of the large number of <a href="seasonal worker">seasonal workers</a> in trades such as <a href="fishing">fishing</a> and <a href="logging">logging</a> who are unemployed for a portion of the year. </p>

Canada has trade deficits with Europe and Asia, just as the Americans do. In 2005, Canada exported about $109 billion worth of goods more than they imported from the U.S. With the rest of the world, Canada had a trade deficit of $47 billion creating an overall surplus of some $62 billion.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

      <p> In the late 1990s, the GDP gap widened. In this period, GDP increased by 5% annually in the United States, and 2% in Canada. Earlier, it had been narrowing between 1961 and 1995. However, it was closing at a much faster rate in the 1960s than the early 1990s. From 1961 to 1973, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5.5% in Canada and 4.0% in the United States. From 1973 to 1995 it was 2.6% in Canada and 2.3% in the USA. <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1997/12/pdf/salgado.pdf">2</a> Canada was not hit as hard by the economic downturn in 2001, however, so cumulative growth in real GDP has been almost exactly the same amount in each country over the last 15 years. </p>

Both countries rank highly with 99% <a href="literacy">literacy</a> rates. The United States has more major consumer goods per capita than Canada. For instance, while Canada had only 297 computers per 1000 people in 1996, the United States had 403. </p> 
      <p> Average income is slightly higher in the United States. However, the gap in median incomes is minor. In terms of racial disparity, United States <a href="African-American">African-Americans</a> and <a href="Hispanic">Hispanics</a> have a lower standard of living than the rest of the population; in Canada, <a href="Aboriginal peoples in Canada">Aboriginal peoples</a> and <a href="Black Canadian">Black Canadians</a> are disproportionately likely to live in poverty, although these groups represent 25% of the US population and only 6% of Canada's.

Canada's <a href="French-Canadians">French-Canadians</a> also used to be a poorer group, but since the <a href="Quiet Revolution">Quiet Revolution</a> in the 1960s this has been partially remedied. </p> 
      <p> The United States measures poverty, while Canada does not have an official measure (see <a href="Poverty in Canada#Measures of poverty in Canada">Poverty in Canada#Measures of poverty in Canada</a>), although <a href="Statistics Canada">Statistics Canada</a> measures something called the <a href="Low-Income Cutoffs">Low-Income Cutoffs</a>, the statistical agency repeatedly states that this is not a poverty measure (it is an income dispersion measure like the <a href="Gini coefficient">Gini coefficient</a>). In the United States the poverty line is set at triple the &quot;minimum adequate food budget.&quot; When a common measure is used, such as that of the <a href="Luxembourg Income Study">Luxembourg Income Study</a>, the United States has higher rates. The LIS reports that Canada has a poverty rate of 15.4% and the United States 18.7%. <a href="http://www.cfc-efc.ca/docs/ccsd/00000324.htm">3</a> In both countries lower incomes are found in those most affected by poverty include single-parent families and single elderly people. </p>

In recent years, what otherwise would have been a reduction in the low-income cutoff, was more than offset by the impact of immigration. According to a 2003 study by Statistics Canada &quot;The rise in the low-income rates in the three major Canadian cities, and in Ontario and B.C. during the 1990s in particular, was largely concentrated among the immigrant population. Basically, low-income rates have been falling over the past two decades among the Canadian born, and rising among immigrants.&quot;<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> A more recent January 2007 study by Statistics Canada explains that the low-income rates of new immigrants has deteriorated by yet another significant amount from 2000 to 2004<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> (see also <a href="Economic impact of immigration to Canada">Economic impact of immigration to Canada</a>). </p>
