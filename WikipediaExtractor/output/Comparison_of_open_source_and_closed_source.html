   <h1 class="article-heading">Comparison of open source and closed source</h1> 
   <div class="article-content"> 
    <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{Use dmy dates|...}}</span> <span class="unknown-node">{{POV|...}}</span> <a href="Free software">Free</a>/<a href="open-source software">open-source software</a> ? the <a href="free software license">source availability model</a> used by <a href="free and open-source software">free and open-source software</a> (FOSS) ? and <a href="closed source">closed source</a> are two approaches to the distribution of software. </p> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2> Background </h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> Under the <i>closed-source</i> model source code is not released to the public. Closed-source software is maintained by a team who produces their product in a <a href="compiler">compiled</a>-executable state, which is what the market is allowed access to. <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, the owner and developer of <a href="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> and <a href="Microsoft Office">Microsoft Office</a>, along with other major software companies, have long been proponents of this business model. Although in August 2010, Microsoft interoperability general manager Jean Paoli said Microsoft &quot;loves open source&quot; and its anti-open-source position was a mistake.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> The <a href="FOSS">FOSS</a> model allows for able users to view and modify a product's source code. Common advantages cited by proponents for having such a structure are expressed in terms of trust, acceptance, teamwork and quality.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> A non-free license is used to limit what <a href="free software movement">free software movement</a> advocates consider to be the essential freedoms. A license, whether providing open-source code or not, that does not stipulate the &quot;four software freedoms&quot;,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> are not considered &quot;free&quot; by the free software movement. A closed source license is one that limits only the availability of the source code. By contrast a <a href="copyleft">copyleft</a> license claims to protect the &quot;four software freedoms&quot; by explicitly granting them and then explicitly prohibiting anyone to redistribute the package or reuse the code in it to make derivative works without including the same licensing clauses. Some licenses grant the four software freedoms but allow redistributors to remove them if they wish. Such licenses are sometimes called <i>permissive software licenses</i>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> An example of such a license is the <a href="FreeBSD License">FreeBSD License</a> which allows derivative software to be distributed as non-free or closed source, as long as they give credit to the original designers. </p> 
      <p> FOSS can and has been commercialized by companies such as <a href="Red Hat">Red Hat</a>, <a href="IBM">IBM</a>, <a href="Novell">Novell</a>, <a href="Oracle Corporation">Oracle</a>, <a href="Mozilla Foundation">Mozilla Foundation</a>, <a href="VMware">VMware</a> and others. </p> 
     </div> 
    </div> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2> Commercialization </h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <div class="section"> 
       <h3> Closed-source software</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{Main|...}}</span> The primary <a href="business model">business model</a> for closed-source software involves the use of constraints on what can be done with the software and the restriction of access to the original source code. This can result in a form of imposed <a href="artificial scarcity">artificial scarcity</a> on a product that is otherwise very easy to copy and redistribute. The end result is that an end-user is not actually purchasing software, but purchasing the right to use the software. To this end, the source code to closed-source software is considered a trade secret by its manufacturers. </p> 
       </div> 
      </div> 
      <div class="section"> 
       <h3> FOSS </h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{Main|...}}</span> FOSS methods, on the other hand, typically do not limit the use of software in this fashion. Instead, the revenue model is based mainly on support services. <a href="Red Hat Inc.">Red Hat Inc.</a> and <a href="Canonical Ltd.">Canonical Ltd.</a> are such companies that give its software away freely, but charge for support services. The <a href="source code">source code</a> of the software is usually given away, and pre-compiled binary software frequently accompanies it for convenience. As a result, the source code can be freely modified. However, there can be some license-based restrictions on re-distributing the software. Generally, software can be modified and re-distributed for free, as long as credit is given to the original manufacturer of the software. In addition, FOSS can generally be sold commercially, as long as the source-code is provided. There are a wide variety of <a href="free software license">free software licenses</a> that define how a program can be used, modified, and sold commercially (see <a href="GNU General Public License">GPL</a>, <a href="GNU Lesser General Public License">LGPL</a>, and <a href="BSD licenses">BSD-type licenses</a>). FOSS may also be funded through donations. </p> 
       </div> 
      </div> 
      <div class="section"> 
       <h3> Handling competition </h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> This model has proved somewhat successful, as witnessed in the <a href="Linux">Linux</a> community. There are numerous GNU/<a href="Linux distribution">Linux distributions</a> available, but a great many of them are simply modified versions of some previous version. For example, <a href="Fedora Linux">Fedora Linux</a>, <a href="Mandriva Linux">Mandriva Linux</a>, and <a href="PCLinuxOS">PCLinuxOS</a> are all derivatives of an earlier product, <a href="Red Hat Linux">Red Hat Linux</a>. In fact, <a href="Red Hat Enterprise Linux">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a> is itself a derivative of Fedora Linux. This is an example of one vendor creating a product, allowing a third-party to modify the software, and then creating a tertiary product based on the modified version. All of the products listed above are currently produced by software service companies. </p> 
        <p> Operating systems built on the <a href="Linux kernel">Linux kernel</a> are available for a wider range of processor architectures than <a href="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, including <a href="PowerPC">PowerPC</a> and <a href="SPARC">SPARC</a>. None of these can match the sheer popularity of the <a href="x86">x86</a> architecture, nevertheless they do have significant numbers of users; Windows remains unavailable for these alternative architectures, although there have been such ports of it in the past. </p> 
        <p> The most obvious complaint against FOSS revolves around the fact that making money through some traditional methods, such as the sale of the use of individual copies and patent <a href="Royalties">royalty</a> payments, is much more difficult and sometimes impractical with FOSS. Moreover, many see<span class="unknown-node">{{Who|...}}</span> the introduction of FOSS as damaging to the market for commercial software.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Most software development companies sell licenses to use individual copies of software as their primary source of income, using a combination of <a href="trade secret">trade secrets</a> and <a href="copyright">copyright</a>, patent, and trademark laws (collectively called <a href="intellectual property rights">intellectual property rights</a> laws).<span class="unknown-node">{{Citation needed|...}}</span> Fees from sale and licensing of commercial software are the primary source of income for companies that sell software. </p> 
        <p> Open-source software has a large number of alternative funding streams, which are actually better-connected to the real costs of creating and maintaining software<span class="unknown-node">{{Citation needed|...}}</span>. After all, the cost of making a copy of a software program is essentially zero, so per-use fees are perhaps unreasonable. At one time, open-source software development was almost entirely volunteer-driven, and although this is true for many small projects, many alternative funding streams have been identified and employed for FOSS: </p> 
        <ul> 
         <li> Give away the program and charge for installation and support (used by many <a href="Linux distributions">Linux distributions</a>).</li> 
         <li> &quot;<a href="Commoditizing the complement">Commoditize complements</a>&quot;: make a product cheaper or free so that people are more likely to purchase a related product or service you do sell.</li> 
         <li> Cost avoidance / cost sharing: many developers need a product, so it makes sense to share development costs (this is the genesis of the <a href="X Window System">X Window System</a> and the <a href="Apache HTTP Server">Apache</a> web server).</li> 
         <li> <a href="Donation">Donations</a></li> 
         <li> <a href="Crowd funding">Crowd funding</a></li> 
        </ul> 
        <p> Increasingly, FOSS is developed by commercial organizations. In 2004, <a href="Andrew Morton (computer programmer)">Andrew Morton</a> noted that 37,000 of the 38,000 recent patches in the <a href="Linux kernel">Linux kernel</a> were created by developers directly paid to develop the Linux kernel. Many projects, such as the X Window System and Apache, have had commercial development as a primary source of improvements since their inception. This trend has accelerated over time.<span class="unknown-node">{{Citation needed|...}}</span> </p> 
        <p> There are some<span class="unknown-node">{{Who|...}}</span> who counter that the commercialization of FOSS is a poorly devised business model because commercial FOSS companies answer to parties with opposite agendas. On one hand commercial FOSS companies answer to volunteers developers, who are difficult to keep on a schedule, and on the other hand they answer to shareholders, who are expecting a return on their investment. Often FOSS development is not on a schedule and therefore it may have an adverse effect on a commercial FOSS company releasing software on time.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
       </div> 
      </div> 
     </div> 
    </div> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2> Innovation </h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> <a href="Gary Hamel">Gary Hamel</a> counters this claim by saying that quantifying who or what is innovative is impossible.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> The implementation of compatible FOSS replacements for proprietary software is encouraged by the <a href="Free Software Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a> to make it possible for their users to use FOSS instead of proprietary software, for example they have been listed <a href="GNU Octave">GNU Octave</a>, an API-compatible replacement for <a href="MATLAB">MATLAB</a>, as one of their <a href="Free Software Foundation#High priority projects">high priority projects</a>, in the past this list contained free binary compatible Java and CLI implementations, like <a href="GNU Classpath">GNU Classpath</a> and <a href="DotGNU">DotGNU</a>. Thus even &quot;derivative&quot; developments are important in the opinion of many people from FOSS. However, there is no quantitative analysis, if FOSS is less innovative than proprietary software, since there are derivative/reimplementing proprietary developments, too. </p> 
      <p> Some of the largest well-known FOSS projects are either legacy code (e.g., FreeBSD or Apache) developed a long time ago independently of the <a href="free software movement">free software movement</a>, or by companies like <a href="Netscape">Netscape</a> (which open-sourced its code with the hope that they can compete better), or by companies like <a href="MySQL">MySQL</a> which use FOSS to lure customers for its more expensive licensed product. However, it is notable that most of these projects have seen <a href="Rewrite (programming)">major or even complete rewrites</a> (in the case of the Mozilla and Apache 2 code, for example) and do not contain much of the original code. </p> 
      <p> Innovations have come, and continue to come, from the open-source world: </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li> <a href="GmailFS">GmailFS</a> is a good example of the collaborative nature of much open-source development. Building on <a href="Filesystem in Userspace">FUSE</a> (which allows filesystems to be implemented in userspace, instead of as code that needs to be loaded into the kernel) combined with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libgmail">libgmail</a>, which is a <a href="Python (programming language)">Python</a> library for programmatic access to a user's <a href="Gmail">Gmail</a> message store, the result is the ability to use the multiple gigabytes of Gmail message space as a fileserver accessible from anywhere on the Internet.</li> 
       <li> <a href="Perl">Perl</a>, the pioneering open-source scripting language, made popular many features, like <a href="regular expressions">regular expressions</a> and <a href="associative array">associative arrays</a>, that were unusual at the time. The newer <a href="Python (programming language)">Python</a> language continues this innovation, with features like functional constructs and class-dictionary unification.</li> 
       <li> <a href="dcraw">dcraw</a> is an open-source tool for decoding <a href="RAW format">RAW-format</a> images from a variety of <a href="digital camera">digital cameras</a>, which can produce better images than the closed-source tools provided by the camera vendors themselves.</li> 
       <li> A number of laptop models are available with a particular emphasis on multimedia capabilities. While these invariably come preinstalled with a copy of Microsoft Windows, some of them<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> also offer an alternative &quot;<a href="Instant on">fast-boot</a>&quot; mode (such as <a href="HyperSpace (software)">Phoenix HyperSpace</a>) based on GNU/Linux. This gets around the long time it can take to boot up Windows.</li> 
       <li> <a href="VLC media player">VLC media player</a>, <a href="Songbird (software)">Songbird</a>, and <a href="Amarok (software)">Amarok</a> are FOSS music players that integrate internet-based data sources to an unprecedented degree, taking song information from <a href="MusicBrainz">MusicBrainz</a>, related track information from <a href="last.fm">last.fm</a>, album cover art from <a href="amazon.com">amazon.com</a> and displaying an artist's Wikipedia page within the player.</li> 
       <li> While admittedly inspired by <a href="Mac OS X">Mac OS X</a>'s <a href="Quartz (graphics layer)">Quartz</a> graphics layer, <a href="Compiz Fusion">Compiz Fusion</a> has pioneered the concept of &quot;plug in&quot; window decorators and animation effects. Users can develop their own creative and unique effects.</li> 
       <li> Open-source telecommunication products, such as the <a href="Asterisk (PBX)">Asterisk PBX</a>, have revolutionized the ICT industry.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span></li> 
       <li> There are substantial efforts towards the implementation of a <a href="semantic desktop">semantic desktop</a> in FOSS communities.</li> 
       <li> Today's desktop environments are innovating regarding their unique idea of a <a href="Social Desktop">Social Desktop</a>.</li>
