The [[Fedorov Avtomat|Fyodorov's assault rifle]] went out of production when the Soviet armed forces decided to standardize its infantry weaponry around only the most popular types of cartridges after the [[Russian Civil War]]. The Soviet Union had returned to the development of an assault rifle in 1942 when the need for an intermediate-powered rifle became clearly evident.{{sfn|Monetchikov|2005|p=22}} By that time [[submachine gun]]s were already in widespread use but they could not replace service rifles because of limited power of pistol cartridges. Like the Germans, the Soviets designed an intermediate cartridge that could be made on existing production lines (despite Vladimir Fyodorov's insistence on a special small-calibre cartridge).{{sfn|Monetchikov|2005|p=134}}<ref name="Williams"/> The work on the weapons for the new ammunition commenced in 1943, with the AK-47 of Mikhail Kalashnikov, the [[SKS|SKS-45]] of [[Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov|Sergei Simonov]] and the [[RPD machine gun|RPD]] of [[Vasily Degtyaryov]] emerging as the victors.

The AK-47 was finalized, adopted and entered widespread service in the Soviet army in the early 1950s.<ref name="washingtonpost2006">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/24/AR2006112400788.html Weapon Of Mass Destruction].

The first confrontations between the AK-47 and the M14 came in the early part of the [[Vietnam War]]. Battlefield reports indicated that the M14 was uncontrollable in full-auto and that soldiers could not carry enough ammo to maintain fire superiority over the AK-47.<ref>Lee Emerson [http://www.imageseek.com/m1a/M14_RHAD_Online_Edition_061010.pdf M14 Rifle History and Development]. October 10, 2006</ref> A replacement was needed: A bridge between the traditional preference for high-powered rifles such as the M14, and the lightweight firepower of the M2 Carbine.
 
As a result, the Army was forced to reconsider a 1957 request by General Willard G. Wyman, commander of the U.S. Continental Army Command (CONARC) to develop a .223 caliber (5.56&nbsp;mm) select-fire rifle weighing 6&nbsp;lbs (2.7&nbsp;kg) when loaded with a 20 round magazine.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The 5.56mm round had to penetrate a standard U.S. [[helmet]] at 500 yards (460 meters) and retain a velocity in excess of the speed of sound, while matching or exceeding the wounding ability of the .30 Carbine cartridge.<ref>Hutton, Robert (ed.), ''The .223'', Guns & Ammo Annual Edition, 1971.</ref> 

This request ultimately resulted in the development of a scaled-down version of the [[Armalite]] [[AR-10]], called AR-15 rifle.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ezell |first=Edward Clinton |title= Small Arms of the World|year= 1983|publisher= Stackpole Books|location=New York |isbn=978-0-88029-601-4|pages=46?47 }}</ref><ref name="nodakspud.com">Peter G.

===AK-47===
{{Main|AK-47}}
[[File:AK-47 and M16 DM-SN-82-07699.JPEG|thumb|right|A U.S. M16A1 rifle (top) is compared to a Soviet AKMS rifle. The two rifles are disassembled into groups.]]
The AK-47 was designed to be a simple, easy to field strip without tools, reliable automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, using mass production methods that were state of the art in the [[Soviet Union]] during the late 1940s. The AK-47's barrel and bolt were milled out of a [[Bar stock|steel billet]] and [[hard chromed]]. Its [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] was originally designed to be stamped from sheet metal with a milled trunnion insert. However, early production receivers were milled in one piece. In 1959, the sheet metal stamping process was perfected, simplifying manufacture and reducing the weight of the rifle from {{convert|3.87|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2.93|kg|lb|abbr=on}} without magazine.<ref name="Dockery 2007 101-103">{{cite book|last=Dockery|first=Kevin|title=Future Weapons|year=2007|pages=101?103|isbn=0-425-21750-7}}</ref> The stock was simply made out of wood, which was a non-strategic material, and perfectly fits the Soviet manufacturing philosophy, where large manufacturing plants could manufacture basic weapons in very large quantities. 

At peak production, [[Izhmash]] can produce around 95 units per hour (about 832,000 units per year).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://englishrussia.com/2012/04/22/how-kalashnikov-guns-are-made/ |title=How Kalashnikov Guns Are Made |publisher=English Russia |date=2012-04-22 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}</ref> Over time, AK-47 descendants have been simplified through the use of spot welding and by further reducing the number of machined parts. Because of its stamped-steel design it is not possible to manufacture the AK-47 series efficiently in small plants, due to the large amount of metal stamping equipment needed for mass production. However, the milled-steel AK-47 has spawned a cottage industry of sorts and has been copied and manufactured (one gun at a time) in small shops around the world.<ref>Soliman M. Santos, Jr. ''et al.''

Earlier versions of the AK-47 used wood furniture, the type and density of which causes the AK-47s weight to vary. Whereas, the M16 and current models of the AK-47 use synthetic materials, which have consistent weights.

!colspan=2|Fire selector
|- valign=top
|The fire selector is located on the left side of the rifle just above the pistol grip and is rotated by the shooter's right thumb. When the selector points forward = safe, up = semi-auto and backward = full-auto or burst. To use, the selector is rotated 90 degrees clockwise (down and forward) into the semi-auto position and then rotated an additional 90 degrees clockwise (forward and up) into the full-auto or burst position. To return to safe the selector is then rotated 180 degrees counter-clockwise (down, backward and up). Some M16 type rifles also have an ambidextrous fire selector on the right side of the receiver, designed to be operated by a left-handed shooter's thumb. This selector mirrors its opposite and functions as describe above. 
|The fire selector is a large lever located on the right side of the rifle, it acts as a dust-cover and prevents the charging handle from being pulled fully to the rear when it is on safe. It is operated by the shooter's right fore-fingers and it has 3 settings: up = safe, center = full-auto and down = semi-auto. The reason for this is, under stress a soldier will push the selector lever down with considerable force bypassing the full-auto stage and setting the rifle to semi-auto. To set the AK-47 to full-auto requires the deliberate action of centering the selector lever.<ref name="arsenalinc1"/> Some AK-47 type rifles also have a small vertical selector lever on the left side of the receiver just above the pistol grip.<ref name="arsenalinc1">{{citation |first=Peter G. |last=Kokalis |title=Kalashnikovs - 3 of the best: Born in Bulgaria, Made in the USA |url=http://www.arsenalinc.com/usa/imgs/articles/BulgarianAK.pdf |journal=Shotgun News |volume=59 |issue=12 |date=May 2005}}</ref> This lever is operated by the shooter's right thumb and has three settings: forward = safe, center = full-auto and backwards = semi-auto.<ref name="arsenalinc1"/>

The AK-47's heavier 7.62x39mm round has superior penetration when compared to the M16's lighter 5.56x45mm round and is better in circumstances where a soldier has to shoot through heavy foliage, walls or a common vehicle's metal body and into an opponent attempting to use these things as cover. The 7.62x39mm M43 projectile does not generally fragment and has an unusual tendency to remain intact even after making contact with bone.

The original ammunition for the M16 was the 5.56x45mm M193 round. When fired from a 20? barrel at ranges of up to 100 meters, the thin-jacketed lead-cored round traveled fast enough (above 2900&nbsp;ft/s) that the force of striking a human body would cause the round to yaw (or tumble) and fragment into about a dozen pieces of various sizes thus created wounds that were out of proportion to its caliber.<ref name="ammo.ar15.com"/><ref name="autogenerated7"/> These wounds were much larger than those produced by AK-47 and they were so devastating that many considered the M16 to be an inhumane weapon.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ian V.

In March 1970, the U.S. recommended that all [[NATO]] forces adopt the [[5.56x45mm]] cartridge.<ref name="autogenerated3">Per G. Arvidsson [http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2009infantrysmallarms/wednesdaysessionvArvidsson.pdf Weapons & Sensors]. NATO Army Armaments Group</ref> This shift represented a change in the philosophy of the military's long-held position about caliber size. By the middle of the 1970s, other armies were looking at M16-style weapons. A NATO standardization effort soon started and tests of various rounds were carried out starting in 1977.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> The U.S. offered the 5.56x45mm M193 round, but there were concerns about its penetration in the face of the wider introduction of [[ballistic vest|body armor]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In the end the Belgian 5.56x45mm SS109 round was chosen ([[STANAG]] 4172) in October 1980.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> The SS109 round was based on the U.S. cartridge but included a new stronger, heavier, 62 grain bullet design, with better long range performance and improved penetration (specifically, to consistently penetrate the side of a steel helmet at 600 meters).<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Due to its design and lower muzzle velocity (about 3110&nbsp;ft/s)<ref name="archivemil"/> the Belgian SS109 round is considered more humane because it is less likely to fragment than the U.S. M193 round.<ref name="m1-18"/> The NATO 5.56x45mm standard ammunition produced for U.S. forces is designated [[M855]].

Most, if not all, of the 7.62x39mm ammunition found today is of the upgraded M67 variety. This variety deleted the steel insert, shifting the center of gravity rearward, and allowing the projectile to destabilize (or yaw) at about 3.3&nbsp;inches, nearly 6.7&nbsp;inches earlier in tissue than the M43 round.<ref>Military rifle bullet wound patterns ? by Martin L. Fackler. From: http://www.uthr.org/SpecialReports/Military_rifle_bullet_wound_patterns.htm. Retrieved on November 9, 2011</ref> There is now relative parity between the wounding capacity of the M67 and the current M855 5.56x45mm round. However, there have been repeated and consistent reports of the M855's inability to wound effectively (i.e. fragment) when fired from the short barreled M4 carbine (even at close ranges).<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The M4's 14.5" barrel length reduces muzzle velocity to about 2900&nbsp;ft/s.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110616210348/http://www.colt.com/mil/M4_2.asp M4 5.56mm Carbine]. colt.com.

The US Army contended in 2003 that the lack of lethality of the 5.56x45mm was more a matter of perception than fact.<ref name="militec2">[http://militec1.com/swat.pdf Project manager soldier weapons soldier weapons assessment team report 6-03].

===Accuracy===

The M16 has always enjoyed a reputation for excellent accuracy.<ref name="autogenerated2">Gun Digest Book of the AR-15, Volume 2 By Patrick Sweeney{{page needed|date=July 2012}}</ref><ref name="defenseindustrydaily1">{{cite web|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/the-usas-m4-carbine-controversy-03289/ |title=The USA's M4 Carbine Controversy |publisher=Defenseindustrydaily.com |date=2011-11-21 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref> The newer M16 models are more accurate than their predecessors and are capable of shooting 1?3 inch groups at 100 yards.<ref name="alpharubicon2">[http://www.alpharubicon.com/leo/akseries.htm Avtomat Kalashnikov].

Curiously, the newer stamped steel receiver AKM models are less accurate than their predecessors.<ref name="alpharubicon2"/> "There are advantages and disadvantages in both forged/milled receivers and stamped receivers. Milled/Forged Receivers are much more rigid, flexing less as the rifle is fired thus not hindering accuracy as much as stamped receivers. Stamped receivers on the other hand are a bit more rugged since it has some give in it and have less chances of having metal fatigue under heavy usage."<ref name="alpharubicon2"/> As a result, the milled AK-47's are capable of shooting 3?5 inch groups at 100 yards, whereas the stamped AKMs are capable of shooting 4?6 inch groups at 100 yards.<ref name="alpharubicon2"/> The best shooters are able to hit a man-sized target at 800 metres with 5 shots (firing from prone position or a trench) or 10 shots (standing).<ref>AKM manual (1983), p. 155 (under the default conditions (no wind, sea level, {{convert|15|C|F|0}}).</ref>

'''Additional firepower'''

All current M16 type rifles are capable of launching NATO STANAG type 22mm [[rifle grenade]]s from their integral flash hiders without the use of an adapter.<ref name="autogenerated8">http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=AD0458570 | Limited Range Test of the M16 Rifle with Eight Types of Rifle and Hand Grenades.

The "bullet trap" and "shoot through" types, as their names imply, use live ammunition. The U.S. military does not generally use rifle grenades,<ref group=notes>The [[USMC]] is currently seeking to purchase commercial off-the-shelf bullet-trap or shoot-through rifle-grenades. These grenades will provide individual Marines additional firepower and will allow indirect fire against targets in defilade, behind walls and buildings or rooftops and elevated positions at ranges between 30 and 150 meters.

Some AK-47 type rifles like the [[Zastava M70]]s  are also capable of launching rifle-grenades and have a grenade-launching ladder-type sight and gas cut-off, attached to the front end of the gas cylinder and coupled to the gas regulator.<ref name="Century 2000.

Page 296"/><ref>http://home.roadrunner.com/~m70AK3/M70.htm |M70AB2 & M70B1 Yugoslavian Battle Rifles</ref>

All current model M16 and AK-47 rifles can mount under-barrel grenade-launchers such as the [[M203 grenade launcher|M203]], [[M320 grenade launcher|M320]] and [[Heckler & Koch AG36|AG36]] in the case of the M16, and the [[GP-25|GP-25, GP-30 & GP-34]] for the AK-47. AKM and AKS-74U can also mount the [[BS-1 Tishina]] and BS-1M Kanareika noiseless grenade launchers (with noiseless discharge) for covert operations. The M16 can also mount under-barrel 12 gauge shotguns such as [[KAC Masterkey]] or the [[M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System]].

All of these grenades, launchers and shotguns add additional bulk and weight to the soldiers war-load and as a result, they reduce the amount rifle ammunition that soldiers can carry.

===Recoil===

With the proper mind-set, training and practice, soldiers armed with both the AK-47 and M16 are quite deadly. The M16's straight-line recoil design, direct impingement gas operation system and smaller caliber gives it less [[recoil]] than the AK-47 and makes it easier to control in full-auto.<ref name="SAOW2">{{Cite book|last=Ezell |first=Edward Clinton |title= Small Arms of the World|year= 1983|publisher= Stackpole Books|location=New York |isbn=978-0-88029-601-4|pages=746?762 }}</ref> The M16's straight-line recoil design, where the recoil spring is located in the stock directly behind the action,<ref name="SAOW2"/> and serves the dual function of operating spring and recoil buffer.<ref name="SAOW2"/> The stock being in line with the bore also reduces muzzle rise, especially during automatic fire. Because recoil does not significantly shift the point of aim, faster follow-up shots are possible and user fatigue is reduced. However, the AK-47's heavier weight and slower rate-of-fire do a good job at mitigating any disadvantage. In addition, newer AK-47 type rifles use a [[Muzzle brake| muzzle brake or compensator]] to reduce recoil.<ref name="ak103"/> And, some AK type rifles also have [[Foregrip|vertical foregrips]] to improve handling characteristics and to counter the effects of [[recoil]].<ref name="Jane's Guns Recognition Guide 2005. p 308-309">Jane's Guns Recognition Guide.

===Reliability===
[[File:Gas OPR.gif|thumb|right|Diagram of long-stroke gas operation system]]
The AK-47 has always enjoyed a reputation of rugged reliability.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kahaner|first=Larry|title=AK-47: The Weapon that Changed the Face of War|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-16880-6|pages=52?53}}</ref> It is long-stroke [[gas operated]], using the gas from the barrel to push a piston attached to the bolt carrier, thus operating the action. The gas tube is fairly large and is visible above the barrel with ports or vents to allow the excess "dirty" gas to escape without affecting the action. The AK-47 is often built with generous clearances, allowing it to function easily in a dirty environment with little or no maintenance. This makes it reliable but less accurate.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Steve|title=Twenty-First Century Small Arms|year=2003|publisher=Zenith Press|isbn=978-0-7603-1503-3|pages=63?64}}</ref> It is very simple to disassemble and clean, and easy to maintain.

The M16 uses a [[direct impingement]] (DI) gas system, similar to normal gas operation in principle, but unique in operation. The gas is sent from the barrel, through the gas tube, directly to the inside of the receiver so it can push on the bolt carrier itself. This means that the gas alone impinges upon the bolt carrier. This design is much lighter and more compact than a gas-piston design. However, this design requires that combustion byproducts from the discharged cartridge be blown into the receiver as well. This quickly accumulating carbon and vaporized metal build-up within the receiver and bolt-carrier negatively affects reliability and necessitates more intensive maintenance on the part of the individual soldier. The DI operation increases the amount of heat that is deposited in the receiver while firing the M16 and causes essential lubricant to be "burned off". This requires frequent and generous applications of appropriate lubricant.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Lack of proper lubrication is the most common source of weapon stoppages or jams.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The original M16 fared poorly in the jungles of [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and was infamous for reliability problems in the harsh environment. As a result, it became the target of a Congressional investigation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kahaner|first=Larry|title=AK-47: The Weapon that Changed the Face of War|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-16880-6|page=236|quote=This was dubbed the Ichord hearings after Missouri representative Richard Ichord, who championed Congress's inquiry into failures of the M-16 during the Vietnam War. }}</ref> The investigation found that:<ref name="autogenerated5"/> 

{{quote|
# The M16 was billed as self-cleaning (when no weapon is or ever has been).
# The M16 was issued to troops without cleaning kits or instruction on how to clean the rifle.
# The M16 and 5.56x45mm cartridge was tested and approved with the use of a DuPont IMR8208M stick powder, that was switched to Olin Mathieson WC846 ball powder which produced much more fouling, that quickly jammed the action of the M16 (unless the gun was cleaned well and often).
# The M16 lacked a [[forward assist]] (rendering the rifle inoperable when it jammed).
# The M16 lacked a chromed barrel and chamber, causing corrosion problem, contributing to case swelling and extraction failures. (This was considered the most severe problem and required extreme measures to clear, such as inserting the cleaning-rod down the barrel and knocking the spent cartridge out.)}}

When these issues were addressed and corrected by the M16A1, the reliability problems decreased greatly.<ref name=SAOW/> According to a February 1968 [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] report, the M16A1 rifle achieved widespread acceptance by U.S. troops in Vietnam. Only 38 of 2100 individuals queried wanted to replace the M16A1 with another weapon. Of those 38, 35 wanted the [[CAR-15]] (a shorter version of the M16) instead.<ref>Maj. Bruce F.

After the introduction of the M4 Carbine, it was found that the shorter barrel length of 14.5&nbsp;inches also has a negative effect on reliability, as the gas port is located closer to the chamber than the gas port of the standard length M16 rifle: 7.5&nbsp;inches instead of the 13&nbsp;inches.<ref name="armalite.com">[http://www.armalite.com/images/Tech%20Notes%5CTech%20Note%2048,%20Barrel%20Design,%20Heat,%20and%20Reliability,%20030824%E2%80%A6.pdf Technical note 48: the effects of barrel design and heat on reliability]. armalite.com.

===Magazines===

"Magazines are one of the most important elements of any firearm design. They are responsible for the feeding portion of the cycle of operation. Even in the most proven arm that reliably extracts and ejects, the magazine has to be 100-percent reliable for it to consistently feed properly."<ref name="americanrifleman1">{{cite web|last=Bartocci |first=Christopher R. |url=http://www.americanrifleman.org/ArticlePage.aspx?id=2157&cid=4 |title=Feeding the Modern Semi-Automatic Rifle |publisher=Americanrifleman.org |date=2011-07-20 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}</ref> 

The AK-47?s 30-round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber. Their heavy steel construction combined with "feed-lips" (the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber) machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage. These magazines are so strong that "Soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers, and even bottle openers."<ref>http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=419 | Identifying & Collecting the 7.62?39 AK-47/AKM Magazine. by Edward T.

'''Night firing'''

The AR-15 was not equipped with any flash suppressor during the conduct of this test. Also, there was only a small amount of ammunition available for use in the AK-47. As a result, the night firing capability of the both the AR-15 and AK-47 were not properly tested. In a subsequent test at Fort Benning an AR-15 equipped with a flash suppressor was tested against both the M14 and the AK-47. The AK-47 was not equipped with a flash suppressor.<ref name="RES"/>
