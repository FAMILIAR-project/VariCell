   <div class="article-content"> 
    <p> A <b>comparison of <a href="Canadian football">Canadian football</a> and <a href="rugby league">rugby league football</a></b> can be made because of their shared origins, resulting in similarities and shared concepts in terms of scoring and advancing the ball. Aside from <a href="American football">American football</a>, rugby league is the sport most similar to Canadian football. Both sports involve the concept of a limited number of 'downs'/'tackles', and in both sports scoring 'touchdowns'/'tries' takes a clear precedence over goal-kicking. </p> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2>Origins</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{)}}</span> British colonists and the British military in Canada brought <a href="rugby football">rugby football</a> to North America. It, along with <a href="association football">association football</a>, became popular in Canadian and American universities. At the time association football, or &quot;soccer&quot;, and rugby were not as differentiated as they are now and teams would negotiate the rules before playing a game. The sports of <a href="Canadian football">Canadian football</a> and <a href="American football">American football</a> evolved from these intercollegiate games. </p> 
      <p> Meanwhile, in England a <a href="History of rugby league#The schism in England">schism</a> developed in rugby football between those who favoured strict amateurism and those who felt that players should be compensated for time taken off work to play rugby. In 1895 this resulted in the formation of a break-away sport, <a href="rugby league">rugby league</a>, the rules of the two codes of rugby (<a href="rugby union">union</a> and league) would themselves diverge. </p> 
     </div> 
    </div> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2>Overview</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> Modern rugby league has been judged by William K. Frampton as having &quot;an amazing resemblance to the original Canadian game&quot;.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Frampton characterised rugby league as &quot;so similar to the game <a href="Piffles Taylor">Neil Taylor</a> played that is effectively an improved version of it&quot;.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> However the games diverged subsequently resulting in major differences such as the forward pass, where the ball is thrown to a receiver located farther down field. </p> 
     </div> 
    </div> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2>The field</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{)}}</span> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> </p> 
      <p> The Canadian football field is <span class="unknown-node">{{)}}</span> long and <span class="unknown-node">{{)}}</span> wide with <a href="end zone">end zones</a> <span class="unknown-node">{{)}}</span> deep. At each goal line is a set of <span class="unknown-node">{{mid)}}</span> <a href="goalposts">goalposts</a>, which consist of two <i>uprights</i> joined by a <span class="unknown-node">{{mid)}}</span> crossbar which is <span class="unknown-node">{{)}}</span> above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts <span class="unknown-node">{{)}}</span> above the ground) is preferred. </p> 
      <p> A rugby league field is similar, it may be 112-122 by 68 metres<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> (122.5-133.4 &times; 74.3 yards). The longer boundary lines are <i>touch lines</i>, while the shorter boundary lines are <i>dead ball lines</i>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The touch lines and dead ball lines are out of play.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Near each end of the field is a <i>goal line</i>,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> or try-line; they are 100 metres (109.4 yards) apart.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> A scoring area equivalent to an end-zone called the <i>in-goal area</i> extends 6?11 metres (6.6-12 yards) from each try-line to each dead ball line, the ball may be grounded to score a <a href="try">try</a> here.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> On the goal line are a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter 'H', used for other forms of point scoring: <a href="Drop goal (rugby)">drop goal</a>, penalty goal and <a href="Try#Conversion">conversion</a>. </p>

     <h2>Players</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{ Rugby league positions)}}</span> </p> 
      <p> Canadian teams have twelve players on the field per side. Different players may be interchanged at will for offence and defence as well as special teams for specific activities. </p> 
      <p> In rugby league the same players both defend and attack - a system known as the <a href="one-platoon system">one-platoon system</a> in Canadian football. There are thirteen players and four replacements in a rugby league team, with twelve interchanges of players allowed to be made throughout the game. If the interchanges are used up and a player becomes injured and cannot continue, the team simply has to play a man short. </p>
