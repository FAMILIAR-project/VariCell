Fans and scholars of '''''[[Star Trek]]''''', owned by [[CBS Television Studios]], and '''''[[Star Wars]]''''', owned by the [[Lucasfilm]] division of [[The Walt Disney Company]], compare the [[Media franchise|franchises]]' merits while [[merchandising|merchandisers]] compete to sell rival products.<ref name="forbes">{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/business/2005/05/16/cx_de_0516match.html|title=Star Wars Vs.

Ewalt]]|date=2005-05-18|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}</ref> Media critics and analysts have compared and contrasted the two works in particular because of their great impact and similarities. The franchises are both large bodies of work that make up billions of dollars of [[intellectual property]], providing work and [[entertainment]] for millions of people.<ref name=HC>{{citation|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=130035|title=Trekkers VS Lucasites|date=May 14, 1999|author=Richard Ho|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}</ref>

==Characteristics and commentary==
''Star Wars'' was inspired by the [[Flash Gordon]] adventure serials of the 1940s<ref>{{citation|title=Adventure films ride back out of the sunset|publisher=The Washington Times|date=January 11, 2001|author=John M. Whalen|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69003346.html}}</ref> and presents an elemental struggle between [[good and evil]].<ref name=HC/> ''[[Star Trek]]'' was conceived in the style of the TV western ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and the adventure stories of [[Horatio Hornblower]] but adopted a more adult tone, providing an idealistic, [[utopian]] prospect of future human [[society]]. While ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] was inspired by works such as [[Beowulf]] and [[King Arthur]], and the origins of myth and world religions,<ref name=Dreams>''Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy''. Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary. [2005]</ref> ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] was inspired by stories like ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' that implied a [[morality tale]].<ref>See [[David Alexander (author)|David Alexander]], "Star Trek Creator. The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry" and interview with Roddenberry in "Something about the Author" by Gale Research Company and chapter 11 of "Trash Culture: Popular Culture and the Great Tradition" by Richard Keller Simon</ref>

The two franchises nonetheless have a "symbiotic relationship", states 
[[William Shatner]], who credits ''Star Wars'' for the beginning of the [[Star Trek (film franchise)|''Star Trek'' films]].<ref name="dominguez19990517">{{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120112134840/http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archivedate=2012-01-12 | title=William Shatner's Trek Never Ends The Actor-author Keeps Seeking New Challenges While Feeding Fans' Hunger For All Things Kirk | work=New York Daily News | date=1999-05-17 | accessdate=October 14, 2011 | author=Dominguez, Robert}}</ref> The documentary ''[[Trek Nation]]'' features interviews where both [[George Lucas]] and [[Gene Roddenberry]] praise one another's respective franchises, with the former stating that ''Star Trek'' was an influence while writing the original screenplay for ''Star Wars''. Also, William Shatner was a presenter at George Lucas' AFI Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony. In 2011, ''Star Wars'' actress [[Carrie Fisher]] and Shatner posted a series of humorous online videos criticizing each other's franchises.

Richard Ho, writing for ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', states that the heroes of ''Star Wars'' such as [[Han Solo]] and [[Luke Skywalker]] have a [[swashbuckling]] style while the protagonists of Star Trek such as [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]] and [[Spock|Mr. Spock]] resolve their challenges with [[science]] and [[intellect]].<ref name=HC/>

[[David Brin]] contrasted the moral and political messages of the two works in ''"Star Wars" despots vs. "Star Trek" populists'', characterizing the philosophy of Star Wars as elitist and authoritarian, as compared with the more progressive and egalitarian spirit of Star Trek.<ref>{{citation|publisher=Salon|author=David Brin|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/06/15/brin_main/|date=June 15, 1999|title="Star Wars" despots vs. "Star Trek" populists}}</ref>

A key difference between the franchises may be that Star Trek is science fiction while Star Wars is space fantasy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/08/great-geek-debates-star-trek-vs-star-wars/|title=Great Geek Debates: Star Trek vs. Star Wars|last=Blum|first=Matt|date=August 5, 2009|work=GeekDad|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=2009-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Geraghty|first=Lincoln|title=Living with Star Trek: American culture and the Star Trek universe|publisher=I.

{{quote|Trek fandom revolves around technology because the Star Trek universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and ''Gong Show''-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been brilliant. The science in Star Wars is nonsense, and everyone knows it. But no one cares because Star Wars isn't about science. It's epic drama. It's about those incredibly well-developed characters and the moral decisions they face. People don't get into debates about how the second Death Star works. They get into debates about the ethics of blowing it up.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/29/technology/game-theory-star-wars-world-with-a-sense-of-humor.html |title=GAME THEORY; 'Star Wars' World With a Sense of Humor |last=Herz |first=J.C. |date=29 October 1998 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-10-12}}</ref>}}

''[[The Denver Post]]'' highlights two differences in approach, noting Star Wars' "swashbuckling" and "gunslinger" style compared with Star Trek's "broader themes of utopian living, justice and identity". ''The Post'' says the spiritual aspect of Star Wars contrasts with the balance of emotion and logic in Star Trek.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_13518101 |title="Star Wars" vs. "Star Trek": The final frontier of marketing is an expanding universe |last=Wenzel |first=John |date=11 October 2009 |work=[[The Denver Post]] |accessdate=2009-10-12}}</ref>

In 2001, the documentary ''Star Wars vs. Star Trek: The Rivalry Continues'' was released on [[DVD]] by Passport Video.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.msn.com/movies/movie.aspx?m=69781 |title=Star Wars vs. Star Trek: Overview |accessdate=2007-09-16 |author=Perry Seibert |date= |work=Allmovie |publisher=MSN Movies}}</ref> It covers a brief history of the development of both franchises.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/review/822/Star+Wars+Vs+Star+Trek |title=Star Wars vs. Star Trek ?
