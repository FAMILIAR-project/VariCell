'''Comparison of rugby league and rugby union''' is possible because of the games' similarities and shared origins. Initially, following the 1895 split in [[rugby football]], [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]] differed in administration only. Soon however, the rules of rugby league were modified, resulting in two distinctly different forms of rugby. After 100 years rugby union joined rugby league, and most other forms of football, as an openly [[professional sport]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Ian|title=The bluffer's guide|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/09/1065676101199.html|accessdate=27 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=10 October 2003}}</ref> One the most prominent differences between the two sports today is that rugby league has a system of limited [[tackle (football move)#Rugby league|tackle]]s  whereas rugby union does not.

'''Miller:''' "Yes, that?s just you to a T; you?d make it so that no lad whose father wasn?t a millionaire could play at all in a really good team. For my part I see no reason why the men who make the money shouldn?t have a share in the spending of it."]]
The precursor to both rugby union and rugby league was [[rugby football]]. During this early period different schools used different rules, on many occasions agreeing upon them shortly before commencement of the game.<ref name="Marshall13-14">{{Harvnb|Marshall|1951|pp=13?14}}</ref> In 1871, English clubs met to form the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU).

A proposal to pay players up to six shillings when they missed work because of match commitments was voted down by the RFU.

In 1906, [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Black]] [[George William Smith (New Zealand)|George William Smith]] joined with [[Albert Henry Baskerville]] to form a team of professional rugby players. George Smith [[telegram|cabled]] a friend in Sydney and three professional matches were arranged between a NSW rugby team before continuing onto the UK. This game was played under the rugby union laws and it wasn't until the team, nicknamed the [[1907-08 All Golds tour|All Golds]], arrived in Leeds that they learnt the new Northern Union laws. Meanwhile in Sydney a meeting was organised to look at forming a professional rugby competition in Australia. The meeting resolved that a "[[New South Wales Rugby Football League]]" (NSWRFL) should be formed, to play the Northern Union rules. The first season of the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership|NSWRFL competition]] was played in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1908|1908]], and has continued to be played every year since.

During rugby league's [[1921?22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]], the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] tried to arrange a match in Paris, but opposition from the [[Rugby Football Union]]-aligned [[French Rugby Federation]] made it impossible.<ref>{{cite book

|accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref> In France rugby league split from rugby union in the 1930s. In 1948 the French instigated the formation of the [[International Rugby League Board]] as the world governing body for rugby league. France, New Zealand, Britain and Australia (who joined a few months later) were the founding countries. The [[International Rugby Board|International Rugby Football Board]] (IRFB) had formed prior to the schsim in 1886 and remained the international governing body for rugby union, although it originally only consisted of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. Australia, New Zealand and South Africa joined the IRFB in 1948, France in 1978 and Argentina, Canada, Italy and Japan in 1991.

On 26 August 1995 the IRFB, now known as the International Rugby Board, declared rugby union an "open" game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game.<ref>{{cite web|title = History of the RFU |url = http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx|work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |date=|accessdate =28 September 2011}}</ref>

Rugby union sevens is a core event at both the [[Commonwealth Games]] and the [[Asian Games]]. The oldest international rugby union competition is the [[Six Nations Championship]], starting in 1883 with games played between England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. France joined in 1910 and Italy in 2000. In 1996 the Southern Hemisphere teams of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand started their own annual international competition known as the Tri Nations; it adopted its current name of [[The Rugby Championship]] when Argentina joined in 2012. The major annual international competition in rugby league is the Four Nations, first played in 1999. It originally involved Britain, Australia and New Zealand before expanding to include a fourth invited nation in 2009. Rugby league introduced its [[Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]] in 1954 and it has been held intermittently since, in various formats. Rugby union's first [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] was held in 1987 and it is contested every four years.

==Etymology==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2012}}
{{see also|Football (word)}}

In the United Kingdom, rugby union or rugby league fans rarely refer to their sport as "football" as in most cases this would refer to [[association football]]. Across the United Kingdom, rugby union is usually referred to simply as 'rugby' but in the [[North of England]], the word 'rugby' could refer to either sport,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1493308_tributes-to-super-fit-glossop-rugby-ace-alex-kaiser-found-dead-in-his-van|title=Tributes to super-fit Glossop rugby ace Alex Kaiser found dead in his van|date=9 May 2012|newspaper=Manchester Evening News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=St Helens bar has licence suspended after rugby player allegedly assaulted|author=Janine Yaqoob|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|date=13 April 2012|url= http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2012/04/13/st-helens-bar-has-licence-suspensed-after-rugby-player-allegedly-assaulted-100252-30749399/#ixzz1yPhXBojQ}}</ref> but usually means 'rugby league'. The nickname "rugger", which developed in England's elite schools, almost always refers to rugby union.

In France, rugby union is called ''rugby ? quinze'' (rugby with 15) or simply "rugby" whilst rugby league is known as ''rugby ? treize'' (rugby with 13) or ''jeu ? treize'' (game with 13) or ''treize'' (13).<ref>[http://www.francerugby.fr/regles/acueil_regles.html R?gles du rugby ?

===Possession===

A big difference in gameplay between the two games is that rugby league has shed from its laws several opportunities for possession to be contested that rugby union has retained: contesting the ball after the tackle, on the ground in rucks and through mauls.<ref name="telfer2010-05-05">{{cite web|last=Telfer |first=Jim |title=It?s Le Crunch for Magners League |url=http://sport.stv.tv/rugby/175081-its-le-crunch-for-magners-league/ |publisher=[[STV (TV network)|STV]] |accessdate=25 July 2010 |authorlink= Jim Telfer |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5rUuLpsQ3 |archivedate= 25 July 2010 |date=5 May 2010 }}</ref> When the ball goes into touch, possession in rugby union is contested through a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line-out]], while in rugby league a scrum restarts play.

In union the attacking team can hold onto and use the ball for as long as they are able, while the opposition's aim is to take possession of the ball from them. In league each team can be [[six tackle rule|tackled six times]] before handing over possession. After being tackled five times, the attacking team will usually kick the ball either in an attacking kick or for territory. As the ball can only be contested during a [[one on one tackle]] in league there is a greater scope for a turnover to occur in rugby union.<ref name="collins2010-05-06"/> A study commissioned by the IRB found that between the years 2002 and 2004 possession was retained by the attacking team in 13 out of 14 tackles in rugby union.<ref name="collins2010-05-06">{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Tony|title=Mythbusters: The 'Contest for Possession'|url=http://rugbyreloaded.blogspot.com/2010/05/mythbusters-contest-for-possession.html|publisher=Rugby Reloaded|accessdate=25 July 2010|authorlink=Tony Collins (historian)|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rUpCLTR0|archivedate=25 July 2010|date=6 May 2010}}</ref> Collins has argued that the six tackle rule in rugby league offers a more even distribution of possession despite fewer opportunities to contest it.<ref name="collins2010-05-06"/> In both games the attacking team loses possession if they drop or pass the ball forward, which results in a scrum being awarded to the defending team.

In union possession can also be contested at line-outs (played after the ball has gone into touch) and scrums. In the same study it was found that the team with the ball at a scrum regained possession 90 percent of the time, while the team with the ball at a lineout regained possession 80 percent of the time.<ref name="collins2010-05-06"/> League does not have a lineout, but does utilise a scrum to restart play. It is uncommon for modern rugby league scrums to be contested, with the side awarded the scrum almost always gaining possession.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rugby league greats of different eras say rugby league scrum is a showpiece of the modern gam|author=Christopher Boy|publisher=Fox Sports|date=29 March 2011|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/league/nrl-premiership/rugby-league-greats-of-different-eras-say-rugby-league-scrum-is-still-relevant-in-the-modern-game/story-fn2mcuj6-1226029371347}}</ref> Possession can also be contested following kicks to restart play from the halfway, 22 metre in both games (and from the goal line in league).

Possession may change the same ways in both games:
# When the ball is kicked to the opposing team, this can be done at any time but it is normal to [[Punt kick|punt]] on the last tackle in rugby league.
# Following an unsuccessful kick at goal. If the kick at goal misses and goes dead play is restarted with a drop out (at the 22 metre line in union and 20 metres in league).
# When an opposing player intercepts a pass.
# When the player in possession drops the ball and it is recovered by an opposition player.
# If a player knocks the ball forward or throws a forward pass the other team is awarded a scrum.
# If a player commits an illegal play the opposing team is awarded a penalty and will receive the ball.

Possession may change in rugby league in a number of unique ways:
# In rugby league if the ball goes out of play, the opposition are awarded a scrum. If this is from a kick going into touch on the full this is called [[ball back]] and the scrum is formed where contact with the ball was made. Otherwise, under recent rule changes, the scrum is formed 20 metres from the point of touch. Penalties and 40/20 kicks are exceptions to this rule.
#If a one-on-one tackle is attempted, the tackler can legally strip the ball from the attacking player.
# In rugby league, an automatic handover takes place when the team in possession runs out of tackles.

Possession may change in rugby union in a number of unique ways
# In rugby union if the ball goes out of play the opposition may be awarded a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]. The opposition are awarded a line out if the team in possession kicks the ball out of play and they haven't been awarded a penalty before the kick.
# In rugby union the attacking team may lose possession in a scrum, line out, maul, ruck or tackle.

===Tackling===
{{See also|tackle (football move)}}

In both games tackling is permitted to either bring down the player in possession of the ball or prevent them from making forward progress. Tackling or interfering with a player who is not in possession of the ball is not permitted. In rugby union players must try to grasp a player when making the tackle.<ref>[http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/Law_10_EN.pdf Law 10.4 (g)]</ref> Rugby league players are allowed to make tackles using just their shoulder (termed a shoulder charge). The use of the shoulder charge in rugby league has been debated,<ref>http://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/no-consensus-on-who-shoulders-blame/story-fndujljl-1226437124272</ref> with the [[National Rugby League]] doctors calling for it to be outlawed.<ref>http://www.foxsports.com.au/league/nrl-premiership/south-sydney-star-greg-ingliss-shoulder-charge-on-dean-young-reignites-debate-on-banning-the-tackle/story-fn2mcuj6-1226432426057</ref> Tripping with the leg is not allowed in either code. However, in rugby league, if a tackling player has both hands on the ball carrier, he is allowed to use his legs to bring him to ground.

In rugby league, a tackle is deemed to be complete when the elbow of the arm holding the ball touches the ground, or the player is held in an upright tackle. The ball cannot be further advanced and a play-the-ball or handover must take place. In rugby union, a tackle is deemed to be complete when the player in possession is held on the ground; that player must play the ball (either releasing it, passing it, or if over the try line grounding the ball) immediately. In rugby league a [[Playing rugby league#Play-the-ball|play the ball]] takes place after each tackle. In rugby union, play does not stop when a player is forced to the ground in a tackle, as the tackled player must immediately play the ball, and the tackler must roll away, which will generally mean a [[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]] will form.

The laws of rugby league specifically outlaw the so-called 'voluntary tackle': players are not allowed to go to ground unless they are effectively tackled by an opponent, though in practice this rule is rarely applied. There was no equivalent law in rugby union, in the past going to ground with the ball and protecting it was practised, but in the modern game deliberately falling on the ground to gain an advantage is outlawed by Law 14: "The game is to be played by players who are on their feet. A player must not make the ball unplayable by falling down." A player who falls to ground with the ball or on it must immediately release or pass the ball, or get up with it.

===Scoring===
Union and league have the same ways of scoring, but there are significant differences in the points awarded, and few minor differences in the laws governing the scoring of tries.

The [[try]] is the main way of scoring in both codes; there are [[Try#Scoring a try|some subtle differences]] between the two codes, but the most obvious difference is that a try is worth 5 points in rugby union and 4 points in rugby league. In both games, a [[Conversion (rugby)|conversion]] following a try is worth 2 points. A player tackled just short of the try-line in rugby union can legitimately reach across it and place the ball down for a try. This is not allowed in rugby league unless the momentum of the player continues to take him over the line in one continuous movement. If the tackle is complete, such a move would constitute a 'double movement' and the try would be disallowed.

A [[drop goal]] is worth 3 points in union and 1 in league. A [[Penalty (rugby)|penalty goal]] is worth 3 points in union and 2 points in league.

{{Further|Rugby league playing field|Rugby union playing field}}
[[File:RugbyPitchMetricDetailed.svg|thumb|left|200px|A rugby union field]][[File:NRL Rugby League Field.png|thumb|right|200px|A rugby league field]]A rugby league field is between 112 and 122 metres long by 68m wide. The distance between try-lines is always 100 metres. There are lines going across the field which mark every ten metres. An in-goal area extends six to eleven metres beyond each goal-line. At the goal line is a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter 'H', used for other forms of point scoring: [[Drop goal (rugby)|drop goal]], penalty and [[Conversion (rugby)|conversion]].

A rugby union field is a maximum of 144 metres long by 70m wide. The length from try line to try line is always 100 metres: the only varying distances on a rugby field are the width of the playing field, and the distance from try line to the dead ball line. Lines are painted at the dead ball line, try line, 22 metre line, 10 metre line (broken line) and half way. Lines are also located 5 metres away from the try line and touch line and 15 metres away from the touch line. At the goal line is a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter 'H', used for other forms of point scoring: [[Drop goal (rugby)|drop goal]], penalty and [[Conversion (rugby)|conversion]].{{clear left}}

Many of the positions have similar names but in practice are very different. The position known as 'flanker' has no equivalent in rugby league; rugby league centres are split into left and right centre rather than inside and outside centres.

The reduction in the importance of the scrum and the removal of the ruck and line out, from Rugby League has meant the difference in skill sets and body types between different positions has become less obvious where as in union players specialise more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnrl.com/news/league-v-union-goes-court|title=League V Union goes to court|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>  For instance, props and hookers in rugby union tend to be among the physically strongest players with high levels of scrummaging and mauling skills, but (traditionally) with limited speed and ball-handling skills. In rugby league, props and hookers may be no slower or less adept at handling the ball than other players because they are not required to perform the physical aspects of scrummaging or contesting possession after a tackle and subsequently they are not required to perform the specialist skills of their rugby union counterparts where size is an advantage. Similarly, locks in union tend to be very tall, as this helps at lineouts; while this is not a necessity for league second rows and may even be a disadvantage. Scrum-half is also a more specialised position in rugby union: the number 9 initiates most moves by his or her team and must be an excellent passer of the ball, whereas in rugby league it is common for any player acting as 'dummy half' to do so.

The similarity between the two games has meant that players can switch between the two codes. League initially recruited big name players from union, like [[Herbert "Dally" Messenger]] in 1907,<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-06-24/dally-messenger-reinstated-to-nswru-record-books/79020</ref> and the RFU responded by banning any player that played rugby league for life.<ref>http://www.rfu.com/TwickenhamStadium/WorldRugbyMuseum/RugbyHistory/AmateurEra</ref> A push into converting union players to rugby league, such as All Blacks [[John Anthony Gallagher|John Gallagher]], [[Frano Botica]] and [[Va'aiga Tuigamala]], occurred in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref name="irishrugby.ie">http://www.irishrugby.ie/news/11928.php</ref> When rugby union became professional league players were allowed to play for rugby union teams, leading to a reversal in crosscode switching. Gallagher, Botica and Tuigamala returned to union and league players such as [[Wendell Sailor]], [[Mat Rogers]], [[Lote Tuqiri]], [[Henry Paul]] and [[Iestyn Harris]], took up rugby union contracts.<ref name="irishrugby.ie"/> Sailor, Rogers, Tuqiri, Paul and Harris have subsequently switched back to rugby league. Players who achieve play international rugby in both codes are known as [[List of dual-code rugby internationals|dual-code internationals]].

==Laws==

Use of a '[[sin bin]]' was introduced by rugby league in 1980.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gatt|first=Ray|title=Ella stars and bears out Big Jack's faith|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19810330&id=EJ9WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3uYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1255,11427494|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=30 March 1981}}</ref> Rugby union had been experimenting with the same concept since 1979,<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Scots against sin bin|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d-89AAAAIBAJ&sjid=zEgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6422,5903207&dq=rugby+union+sin+bin&hl=en|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=24 March 1979}}</ref> although it was not formally sanctioned until 2001.<ref name="cleary2001">{{cite news|last=Cleary|first=Mick|title=World Cup play-offs abandoned|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/3002507/World-Cup-play-offs-abandoned.html|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]]|date=4 April 2001}}</ref>

[[Video referee]] technology was first used for rugby league in 1996<ref>{{cite news|last=Reuter|title=Aussie rebels to follow Euro lead|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F_5OAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XBUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1210,3030619|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=[[New Straits Times]]|date=8 October 1996}}</ref> and for rugby union in 2001.<ref name="cleary2001"/>

In rugby league the ball may be thrown or knocked out of play deliberately while in union those are penalty offences. Kicking the ball out of play is legal in both codes.

When taking free or penalty kicks with a 'tap and go' option, rugby league permits a stylised kick with the ball being tapped against the foot or lower leg while union requires the ball to leave the hands of the kicker. This difference in emphasis on a relatively trivial phase of play can be seen as indicative of the core differences between the games. In league, the kick is stylised as its purpose is to restart the game and to move to the run and tackle main play as quickly as possible. In union, where ''every'' phase of play has some element of competition, the trivial need to release the ball at any kick can result in a fumble that may give the opposition a chance to either contest possession or, if 'knocked-on', will cause them to be awarded a scrum.

==Cross-code games==

In 1909, when the new "Northern Union" code was still in its infancy, a match between the [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] and the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] was played before a crowd of around 20,000, with the rugby league side winning 29-26.<ref>{{Cite news  | last =  | first =  | coauthors =  | title = Kangaroos v. Wallabies  | work = West Coast Times  | place =New Zealand  | page = 4  | language =  | publisher =  | date = 6 September 1909  | url = http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=WCT19090906.2.33.3  | accessdate =3 December 2009}}</ref>
With the wartime Emergency League suspended, [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds Rugby League]] reverted to rugby union during World War I to play a one-off challenge game against the Royal Navy Depot from Plymouth in 1917. This was pre-cursor to the following Christmas when two Challenge games were organised between the two sides but this time with one of each code. The Navy won the union game 9-3 on Christmas Eve but proved equally adept at league recording a 24-3 win on 28 December. During World War II, the [[RFU]] relaxed its restrictions on rugby league players playing rugby union. In 1943, a Northern Command army rugby league side defeated a Northern Command union side 18-11 at Headingley under rugby union laws. The following year a Combined Services rugby league side beat a Combined Services union side 15-10 at Bradford again at rugby union. These were the only league v union matches played until 1996.<ref>http://www.napit.co.uk/viewus/infobank/rugby/superleague/history.php</ref>

With both sports becoming professional matches between union and league teams have been played. In May 1996, [[Bath Rugby]] and [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan RLFC]], who were then England's top union and league sides respectively, made history by [[Clash of the Codes (rugby)|playing against each other at both codes of rugby]]. Wigan won 82-6 in the first match, played under league rules, and lost the second 44-19 under union rules. Since then other games have been played between union and league teams using the laws of one of the codes, or in some cases using a different set of laws each half. 

Since the two match series in 1996, there has only been one similar endeavor to bring together union and league. In January 2003, St Helens rugby league took on Sale rugby union in a single game played at Knowsley Road, intended to have one half under league rules and the other under union rules. Unlike Bath, who were to all intents and purposes still the amateur side they had been, Sale had the benefit of almost a decade of professionalism to improve both strength and fitness that was necessary for them to adapt to the constant tackling required in rugby league. Sale prevailed against St Helens in front of a fierce St Helens home crowd at Knowsley Road, winning the match against St Helens 41- 39.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/2700407.stm|publisher= bbc.co.uk|title=Sale spring cross-code shock|author=|date=2003-01-27 |accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref>

The inherent similarities between rugby league and rugby union has at times led to the possibility of a merger being mooted<ref name="thisislondon2000"/> and experimental hybrid games have been played that use a mix of the two sports' rules.<ref name="growden1"/>

==Demographics==

Traditionally, the two rugbys have been seen as divided along class lines, with union associated more with the middle class, and league with the working class.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bowden|first=David|title=Tackling rugby union?s superiority complex|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/7339|accessdate=27 May 2012|newspaper=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]|date=4 September 2009}}</ref> One of the main reasons for the split was union's enforcement of the amateur principle, meaning that working class players could not afford to take time off work to play the sport.<ref>http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/working-class-formed-a-league-of-their-own/story-e6frexni-1111118120858</ref> In Australia the two codes were also strongly divided down class lines.<ref>{{cite book|page=180|title=Rugby's great split: class, culture and the origins of rugby|author=Tony Collins|year=2006}}</ref>

==Finance and scale==

In the UK, the 'two codes' of rugby are very different in scale and turnover. The turnover of the RFL was reported as ?29m in 2011.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/18895913</ref> For comparison, the turnover of the Rugby Football Union in 2011 was ?130m.<ref>http://www.thelawyer.com/part-of-the-union/1012357.article</ref> The number of rugby union players in England is 1.99 million which includes 131,000 senior male players.<ref>http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000002/index.html</ref> The number of players participating in any capacity in Rugby League in England (including wheelchair users) is about 100,000.<ref>http://www.code13rugbyleague.com/2012/02/10/player-participation-passes-100000/</ref> The number of league players in Australia is 58,000 and the number of Union players 42,000.<ref>http://fulltext.ausport.gov.au/fulltext/2000/ascpub/numbers_game.htm</ref> The number of rugby union players in New Zealand is estimated to be 129,000, with 22,000 playing rugby league.<ref>http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_percent_of_new_zealand_play_rugby</ref>

Rugby union generally has a broader reach around the world. For example it is a popular sport in a number of countries such as South Africa and Argentina where rugby league does not have significant popularity.
