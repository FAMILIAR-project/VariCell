    <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{Osteopathic Medicine}}</span> In the United States, there are two types of physicians that practice medicine. Most physicians hold the <a href="Doctor of Medicine">Doctor of Medicine</a> degree (M.D.), while <a href="Osteopathic medicine in the United States">osteopathic</a> physicians hold the <a href="Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine">Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine</a> degree (D.O.).<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Other than teaching <a href="Osteopathic manipulative medicine">manual medicine</a>, the medical training for an M.D. and D.O. is virtually indistinguishable. D.O. physicians complete conventional residencies in hospitals and training programs, are licensed in all states, and have rights and responsibilities, such as military service, that are identical to M.D. physicians and surgeons.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2>Background</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{See also|...}}</span> In 2005, Jordan Cohen, the president of the <a href="American Medical Association">American Medical Association</a> (AMA) stated: </p> 
      <blockquote>
       After more than a century of often bitterly contentious relationships between the osteopathic and allopathic medical professions, we now find ourselves living at a time when osteopathic and allopathic graduates are both sought after by many of the same residency programs; are in most instances both licensed by the same licensing boards; are both privileged by many of the same hospitals; and are found in appreciable numbers on the faculties of each other's medical schools.
       <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span>
      </blockquote> 
      <p> The AMA's current definition of a physician is &quot;an individual who has received a 'Doctor of Medicine' or a 'Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine' degree or an equivalent degree following successful completion of a prescribed course of study from a school of medicine or osteopathic medicine.&quot;<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
     </div> 
    </div> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2>Demographics</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> <span class="unknown-node">ImageLink</span> The sex and racial distribution of DOs and MDs are similar.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Currently, there are significantly more MDs than DOs.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> In the 2010-2011 application cycle, 5,627 students matriculated as first-year students into DO medical programs<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> and 19,230 students matriculated as first-year students into MD programs.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> A 2010 survey of students applying to both U.S. M.D. and D.O schools found that 35% were only admitted to a DO school, 11% were only admitted to an M.D. school, 26% were admitted to both, while the remaining 52% were not admitted to any schools.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Geographic location was the top reason students gave for choosing the school in which they enrolled.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> Of physicians practicing in the United States, 7% are osteopathic physicians (2010),<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> 26% are international medical graduates (2012),<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> while the remaining physicians are U.S. medical graduates (M.D.). Between 1980 and 2005, the annual number of new MDs remained stable at around 16,000. During the same period, the number of new DOs increased by more than 200% (from about 1,150 to about 2,800).<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Graduates from DO medical programs are expected to increase to 3,300 by the year 2010 and as many as 4,000 by 2015.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The number of new MDs per 100,000 people fell from 7.5 to 5.6, while the number of new DOs per 100,000 rose from 0.4 to 0.8.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> The distribution of both M.D. and D.O. physicians in the United States is not uniform, as the number of physicians per capita varies. As of 2009, the states with the most M.D. physicians per capita were the <a href="District of Columbia">District of Columbia</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, and <a href="New York">New York</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The states with the lowest number of M.D. physicians per capita were <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> and <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Osteopathic physicians are more concentrated in the <a href="Midwestern United States">midwestern states</a> than in other regions of the U.S. As of 2011, the states with the most osteopathic physicians per capita were <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The states with the lowest number of D.O. physicians per capita were <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, and <a href="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p>

    <div class="section"> 
     <h2>Cultural differences</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> Some authors describe less quantifiable distinctions between the two medical professions. Avery Hurt writes, &quot;In actual practice, the variations between the two types of physicians are often so slight as to be unnoticeable to patients, and a day in the life of each can appear indistinguishable. But the differences are there, subtle but deep.&quot;<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Several studies have investigated these differences. One study compared the patient interactions of DOs and MDs. The study found that &quot;osteopathic physicians were more likely to use patient's first names and to discuss the social, family and emotional impact of illnesses.&quot; For example, &quot;66% of DOs discussed a patient's emotional state compared with about one-third of MDs.&quot; The same study found that MD qualified &quot;physicians scored higher in discussing literature or scientific basis of treatment.&quot;<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Another study analyzed 341.4 million patient visits to general and <a href="family medicine">family medicine</a> specialists in the United States, including 64.9 million visits to DOs and 276.5 million visits to MDs. It found that there was no significant difference between DOs and MDs &quot;with regard to time spent with patients and preventive medicine services.&quot;<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <div class="section"> 
       <h3>Self-characterization</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> A Harvard study found significant differences in the attitudes of DOs and MDs. The study found that 40.1% of MD students and physicians described themselves as &quot;socioemotionally&quot; oriented over &quot;technoscientific&quot; orientation. 63.8% of their DO counterparts self-identified as socioemotional.

      <div class="section"> 
       <h3>Perceptions</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> One study of DOs attempted to investigate their perceptions of differences in philosophy and practice between themselves and their MD counterparts. 88% of the respondents had a self-identification as osteopathic physicians, but less than half felt their patients identified them as such. The study asked respondents to identify points of philosophical and practical difference between DOs and MDs; no more than 1/3 of respondents could agree on any single such point of difference.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> <span class="unknown-node">{{further2|...}}</span> </p>

      <div class="section"> 
       <h3>Self-Identification</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> As the training of DOs and MDs becomes less distinct, some have expressed concern that their unique characteristics will be lost.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Others welcome the rapprochement and already consider modern medicine to be the type of medicine practiced by both &quot;MD and DO type doctors.&quot;<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> One persistent difference is the respective acceptance of the terms &quot;allopathic&quot; and &quot;osteopathic.&quot; DO medical organizations and medical schools all include the word <i>osteopathic</i> in their names, and such groups actively promote an &quot;osteopathic approach&quot; to medicine. While &quot;osteopathy&quot; was a term used by its founder <a href="Andrew Taylor Still">AT Still</a> to describe his new philosophy of medicine, &quot;<a href="allopathic medicine">allopathic medicine</a>&quot; was originally a derogatory term coined by <a href="Samuel Hahnemann">Samuel Hahnemann</a> to contrast the conventional medicine of his day with his alternative system of <a href="homeopathic medicine">homeopathic medicine</a>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Today, the term &quot;allopathic physician&quot; is used infrequently, usually in discussions relating to osteopathic medicine or alternative medicine. Some authors argue that the term should be dropped altogether, since its original meaning bears little relevance to the current practice of modern medicine<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> and conventional medicine has never endorsed any principle of allopathy.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Similarly, the use of the terms &quot;osteopath&quot; and &quot;osteopathy&quot; are now discouraged when describing osteopathic physicians that have earned the degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and the field of osteopathic medicine, respectively.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

        <p> The <a href="Liaison Committee on Medical Education">Liaison Committee on Medical Education</a> (LCME) accredits the 141 U.S.-medical schools<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> that award the M.D. degree, while the <a href="American Osteopathic Association">American Osteopathic Association (AOA)</a> <a href="Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation">Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation</a> (COCA) accredits the 29 colleges of osteopathic medicine in 37 locations in the United States that award the D.O. degree.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> <a href="Michigan State University">Michigan State University</a> and the <a href="University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey">University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey</a> are the only universities that have both M.D. and D.O. accredited programs.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> In 2009, <a href="Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences">Kansas City University</a> proposed starting a dual MD/DO program in addition to the existing DO program,<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> and the <a href="University of North Texas Health Science Center">University of North Texas</a>, explored the possibility of starting independent M.D. program that would be offered alongside the DO program.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Both proposals were met with controversy. Proponents argued that adding an MD program would lead to more local residencies created, and improve the university?s ability to acquire research funding and state funding. Opponents argue that adding the MD programs could cause the osteopathic program to lose its focus on &quot;holistic care,&quot; would result in more competition for the already limited number of existing residencies (if more were not opened), and would drain resources from the established osteopathic programs. </p> 
        <p> Overall, osteopathic medical schools have more modest research programs compared to M.D. schools, and fewer D.O. schools own a hospital.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Historically, osteopathic medical schools had associations with osteopathic hospitals, which were usually small, rural, community based hospitals.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> However, in 1990s and 2000s, economic and regulatory pressures caused many small hospitals, including most osteopathic hospitals, to either close or join larger hospital networks.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> Osteopathic medical schools tend to have a stronger focus on primary care medicine than M.D. schools.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> D.O. schools have developed various strategies to encourage their graduates to pursue primary care, such as offering accelerated 3-year programs for primary care, focusing clinical education in <a href="community health centers">community health centers</a>, and selecting rural or under-served urban areas for the location of new campuses.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> </p>

However, there have been calls to end the remaining barriers between the two types of programs.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Since 1985, a single residency training program can be dual-accredited by both the ACGME and the AOA.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> By 2015, all post-graduate training for both DOs and MDs will be accredited by the ACGME.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> In 2001, the AOA adopted a provision making it possible for a D.O. resident in any M.D. program to apply for osteopathic approval of their training.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The topic of dual-accreditation is controversial. Opponents claim that by merging D.O. students into the &quot;M.D. world&quot;, the unique quality of osteopathic philosophy will be lost.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> Supporters claim the programs are popular because of the higher prestige and higher resident reimbursement salaries associated with M.D. programs.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> In 2010-2011, approximately 41% of U.S. osteopathic medical students indicated that they intend to pursue an AOA or AOA/ACGME dually-accredited residency programs while 39% indicated that they intend to pursue an ACGME accredited residency program.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> In 2010-2011, approximately 12% of U.S. osteopathic medical students indicated that they intend to pursue an AOA/ACGME dually-accredited residency program, while 29% planned to pursue an AOA residency and 39% planned to pursue an ACGME-accredited residency program.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> The number of dually accredited programs increased from 11% of all AOA approved residencies in 2006 to 14% in 2008, and then to 22% in 2010.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> The most common reason (74%) given by D.O. medical students choosing an ACGME <a href="Residency (medicine)">residency</a> or AOA/ACGME dually-accredited program was a more suitable geographic location.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref .../&gt;</span> M.D. physicians are generally not permitted to train in DO (AOA-accredited) residencies, though this has become a subject of debate within the D.O. profession. The American Osteopathic Association has agreed to study the issue of permitting M.D. physicians to train in D.O. (AOA-accredited) residencies.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
        <p> As of July 2015, the AOA, AACOM, and the ACGME will create a single, unified accreditation system for graduate medical education programs in the United States.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> This will ensure that all physicians trained in the U.S. will have the same graduate medical education accreditation - ACGME. This will also provide DO physicians with the equivalent overseas recognition as their MD counterparts, as the ACGME accreditation is more widely known outside of the United States. </p>

There are subtle differences in the CME requirements for M.D. and D.O. qualified physicians, and in how these CME credits are approved. The requirements for maintaining a physician license for M.D. or D.O. qualified physicians are almost identical in most states, though there are small differences. For example, in the case of Pennsylvania, M.D. licenses begin on December 31, whereas D.O. ones begin on October 31.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

      <p> M.D. qualification training is the most widely available in the U.S.; however, the D.O. medical profession has rapidly expanded, with more than 1 in 5 medical students now entering a D.O. medical school.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Both DOs and MDs have the option to train and practice in any of the medical specialties and sub-specialties. One exception is the Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine specialty which is only available to D.O.'s who have completed a one year traditional internship year.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <p> Both degrees are recognized internationally as a medical degree. Accredited D.O. and M.D. medical schools are both included in the <i>World Health Organization?s World Directory of Medical Schools</i>.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> However, when practicing overseas, an M.D. degree may be easier to negotiate with than a D.O. degree. DOs are more likely than their U.S. M.D. counterparts to have to explain or defend their training, particularly in areas that have non-physician osteopaths. This is rapidly changing as over 55 countries now recognize the D.O. medical degree, and the AOA's Bureau on Osteopathic Medical Education &amp; Affairs is actively working with members to increase that number.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>
