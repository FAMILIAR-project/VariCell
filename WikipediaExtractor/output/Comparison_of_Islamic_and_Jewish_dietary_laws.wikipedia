The [[Islamic dietary laws]] (''[[Halal]]'') and the [[Kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]] (''Kashrut''; in English, ''[[Kosher]]'') are both quite detailed, and contain both points of similarity and discord. While both are dietary laws of [[Abrahamic religions]], they have different roots: an explanation of the Islamic code of law found in the [[Quran]] and a Jewish code of laws found in the [[Talmud]].

For most Muslim sects, Kosher is subset of Halal, accordingly Muslims can generally eat Kosher food, but Jews cannot eat all Halal food.

*Almost all [[insects]] are not kosher. The few kosher insects are specific types of [[locust]]s and [[grasshopper]]s (see [[Kosher locust]]) which are not eaten today in most communities, since it is unknown which species is permitted (the exception being the [[Yemenite Jews]], who claim to have preserved this knowledge).<ref>[http://www.uos.co.za/Kashrut/Default.stm#insects Insects and kosher laws]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> 
*To be kosher, aquatic animals must have scales and fins. Most Muslim schools of thought adhere to the interpretation that all creatures from the ocean or the sea or lake are considered halal.<ref name=JewFAQ /><ref>[http://www.ifanca.org/newsletter/2002_09.htm Newsletter], September 2002.</ref> [[Shi'ites]] also follow this, but make an exception with some crustaceans; shrimps and prawns are halal.<ref name="hunting al islam">[http://www.al-islam.org/laws/hunting.html Hunting] at al-islam.org</ref> According to Jewish oral law all fish that have scales have fins, thus making all fish with scales kosher and rendering the law essentially the same as the more restrictive interpretations of halal.<ref>[http://www.kosherspirit.com/Article.asp?Issue=3&Article=41 Article] at kosherspirit.com</ref><ref>[http://www.torah.org/advanced/shulchan-aruch/classes/chapter1.html Class notes] at torah.org</ref><ref>[http://www.britam.org/law6.html Article] at britam.org</ref>
*[[Gelatin]] is only permissible if it comes from a permissible animal (usually kosher gelatin comes from the bones of kosher fish,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} or is a [[vegan]] substitute{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}).

===Differences===

* For a substance to be halal, it must not contain [[alcohol]] of any kind. However, there is a difference drawn between the addition of alcohol to foods which is absolutely forbidden, and the small quantities that naturally become present ? such as orange juice. Except for grape wine and grape juice (which must be manufactured under Jewish supervision), kashrut allows the consumption of any sort of alcohol, as long as it has kosher ingredients (excluding any unsupervised grape extracts).<ref name="food mgmt 13386" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_101_150/contemporary_world.htm |title=Contemporary world |publisher=Irfi.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}</ref>
* The list of animals forbidden by kashrut is more restrictive, as kashrut requires that, to be kosher, mammals must chew [[cud]] and must have cloven hooves. Halal only requires that an animal survive on grass and leaves. Thus some animals such as the [[camel]] are permissible under halal, but not according to kashrut.<ref name=JewFAQ/><ref name="central mosque halal1" />
* Kashrut prohibits [[shellfish]], such as [[crab]], [[lobster]], [[shrimp]], [[clams]], and [[oysters]].<ref>[http://www.templesanjose.org/JudaismInfo/faq/kashrut.htm Kashrut] at templesanjose.org</ref>
* Kashrut requires strict separation of dairy and meat products, even when they are kosher separately.

==Slaughter==
[[Shechita]] is the ritual slaughter of mammals and birds according to Jewish law. [[Dhabiha]] is the method used to slaughter an animal as per Islamic tradition. Shechita requires that an animal be conscious and this is taken to mean the modern practice of electrical, gas, or percussive stunning before slaughter is forbidden. Most Muslim authorities also forbid the use of electrical, gas, or percussive stunning.{{fact|date=October 2011}}  However, other authorities state that stunning is permissible so long as it is not the direct cause of the animal's death. <ref name="Fatwa on Stunning Animals">[http://www.organic-halal-meat.com/article/fatwa-stunning.php Fatwa on Stunning Animals] at organic-halal-meat.com</ref>

===Similarities===
*Both shechita and dhabiha involve cutting across the neck of the animal with a non-serrated blade in one clean attempt in order to sever the main blood vessels.<ref name=JewFAQ/><ref name="shariah program slaughtering">{{cite web|url=http://www.shariahprogram.ca/eat-halal-foods/islamic-guidelines-slaughtering-animals.shtml |title=Islamic Guidelines Slaughtering Animals |publisher=Shariahprogram.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}</ref>

*Both require draining the blood of the animal.<ref name="shariah program slaughtering" /><ref>[http://www.jewfaq.org/kashrut.htm#Blood Kosher laws regarding blood] at jewfaq.org</ref>
*Any sane adult Jew who knows the proper technique may perform shechita.<ref>[[Maimonides]]' Code, Laws of Shechita 2:12{{psc|date=October 2011}}</ref> Similarly, dhabiha can be performed by any "sane adult Muslim? by following the rules prescribed by [[Shariah]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Rasheeduddin |first=Syed |url=http://www.albalagh.net/halal/kosher_meat.shtml |title=Is Kosher Meat Halal? Not Really |publisher=Albalagh.net |date=2003-05-26 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}</ref> All Islamic authorities, though, state that dhabiha can also be performed by Peoples of the Book-([[Jews]] and [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]]).<ref name="shariah program slaughtering" />

===Differences===
* Dhabiha requires that God's name be pronounced before each slaughter.<ref name="shariah program slaughtering" /> (see [[Islamic Concept of God]]). Dhabiha meat by definition is meat that is slaughtered in the shariah manner and the name of Allah is said before the slaughter. In Shechita, a blessing to God is recited before beginning an uninterrupted period of slaughtering; as long as the [[shochet]] does not have a lengthy pause, interrupt, or otherwise lose concentration, this blessing covers all the animals slaughtered in that period. This blessing follows the standard form for a blessing before most Jewish rituals ("Bless?d are you God ... who commanded us regarding [such-and-such]", in this case, Shechita). The general rule in [[Judaism]] is that for rituals which have an associated blessing, if one omitted the blessing, the ritual is still valid [see Maimonides Laws of Blessings 11:5]; as such, even if the shochet failed to recite the blessing before Shechita, the slaughter is still valid and the meat is kosher.<ref>Maimonides Laws of Slaughter 1:2 and commentaries ad loc{{psc|date=October 2011}}</ref>
* There are no restrictions on what organs or parts of the carcass may be eaten from a ''Halal''-slaughtered and -dressed animal; as long as it was slaughtered and prepared according to the rules of Halal, the entire animal, with the exception of blood, bones, fat not attached to meat, and wounded parts, is fit for consumption by Muslims. However, Kashrut prohibits eating the [[chelev]] (certain types of fat) and ''[[gid hanosheh]]'' (the [[sciatic nerve]]), and thus the hindquarters of a kosher animal must undergo a process called ''[[nikkur]]'' (or, in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], porging) in order to be fit for consumption by Jews. As nikkur is an expensive, time-consuming process, it is rarely practiced outside of [[Israel]], and the hindquarters of kosher-slaughtered animals in the rest of the world are generally sold on the non-kosher market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isaiowa.org/content.asp?ID=1677 |title=What is Halal? |publisher=Isaiowa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}</ref>

==Other comparisons==
===Similarities===
*After slaughter, both require that the animal be examined to ensure that it is fit for consumption. Dhabiha guidelines generally say that the carcass should be inspected,<ref name="shariah program slaughtering" /> while kashrut says that the animal's internal organs must be examined "to make certain the animal was not diseased".<ref name="rabbinical assembly">[http://web.archive.org/web/20101127120203/http://rabbinicalassembly.org/law/kashrut.htmlKashrut] at rabbinicalassembly.org</ref>
*Both sets of religious rules are subject to arguments among different authorities with regional and other related differences in permissible foodstuffs.{{fact|date=October 2011}}
*Strictly observant followers of either religion will not eat in restaurants not certified to follow its rules.{{fact|date=October 2011}}
*Meat slaughtered and sold as kosher must still be salted to draw out excess blood and impurities. A similar practice is followed in some Muslim households, but using [[vinegar]]. This is done to remove all surface blood from the meat, in accordance with Islam's prohibition of the consumption of blood.{{fact|date=October 2011}}

===Differences===
*During the Jewish holiday [[Passover]], there is an additional set of restrictions, requiring that no [[chametz]] (sour-dough starter or fermented products from the five species of grains) be eaten. However this requirement is specific to the holiday, and nothing to do with the laws of Kashrut.<ref name="rabbinical assembly" />
*In general, Kashrut prohibits the mixing of meat and dairy products; consumption of such products or profiting from their sale are also forbidden. These proscriptions are not observed in [[Karaite Judaism]].  Halal has no such rules.<ref>[[Shulchan Aruch]], [[s:Shulchan Aruch/Yoreh Deah#Meat with Milk|Yoreh De'ah Laws of Meat with Milk]]{{psc|date=October 2011}}</ref>
*In Judaism, the permissibility of food is influenced by many secondary factors. For instance, vessels and implements used to cook food must also be kept separate for dairy products and meat products. If a vessel or implement used to cook dairy products is then used to cook meat, the food becomes non-kosher and the vessel or implement itself can no longer be used for the preparation or consumption of a kosher meal. Depending on the material properties of the item (for example, if it is made of metal or of clay, or if it is made in one piece or has joints) it may be rendered permissible ("kashered") by certain procedures or it may be considered irretrievably contaminated.  In general, the same policy extends to any apparatus used in the preparation of foods, such as ovens or stovetops. Laws are somewhat more lenient for modern kitchen items such as microwaves or dishwashers, although this depends greatly on tradition ([[minhag]]) or individuals' own stringent practices (''[[chumrot]]''). As a result of these factors, many Conservative and Orthodox Jews cannot eat dishes prepared at any restaurant that is not specifically kosher, even if the actual dish ordered uses only kosher ingredients. <ref>Shulchan Aruch, [[s:Shulchan Aruch/Yoreh Deah#The Koshering of Implements|Yoreh De'ah Laws of Koshering Utensils]]{{psc|date=October 2011}}</ref>
*Likewise in Islamic food preparation, the permissibility of food is also influenced by many secondary factors. Apart from the prescribed foods that can be consumed, all food must be Halal and by this, all utensils and kitchens used to prepare food must also be deemed as Halal. Halal utensils and kitchens require that these utensils or food preparation surfaces do not get in contact with non Halal items. For instance, cakes prepared using alcohol as an ingredient are considered non Halal. In fact, food cooked in any type of alcohol (even if the alcohol burns out during the cooking process) is also deemed non Halal. Kitchens which have been used to prepare non Halal food must be sanitized (''samak'') according to Islamic principles before they can be used to prepare Halal meals. Kitchens and utensils previously used to prepare non Halal meals are required to be fully sanitized in an Islamic fashion before they can then be used for Halal food preparation.<ref>license2halal.com{{rs|date=October 2011}}</ref>
