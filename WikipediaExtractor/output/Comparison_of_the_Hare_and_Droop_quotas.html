   <h1 class="article-heading">Comparison of the Hare and Droop quotas</h1> 
   <div class="article-content"> 
    <p> <span class="unknown-node">{{Multiple issues|...}}</span> In elections that use the <a href="Single transferable vote">single transferable vote (STV)</a> method, <i>quotas</i> are used (a) for the determination of candidates considered elected; and (b) for the calculation of surplus votes to be redistributed.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Two quotas in common use are the <a href="Hare quota">Hare quota</a> and the <a href="Droop quota">Droop quota</a>. </p> 
    <div class="section"> 
     <h2>General comparison</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> The earliest versions of <a href="Single transferable vote">STV</a> used the <a href="Hare quota">Hare quota</a>. The Hare quota is equal to the total valid poll (V) divided by the total number of seats (n), or V&nbsp;/&nbsp;n. </p> 
      <p> The <a href="Droop quota">Droop quota</a> is smaller than the Hare quota, and was first suggested <span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref ...&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> because it is the smallest quota that, like the Hare quota, ensures that the number of candidates who reach the quota will not be greater than the number of seats to be filled. Any quota smaller than the Droop quota carries a real, or at least theoretical, risk of more candidates being elected than there are seats to be filled. The Droop quota is the next integer larger than V&nbsp;/&nbsp;(n+1). </p> 
      <p> The difference between the two quotas comes down to what the quota implies. Winners elected under a Hare system <b>represent</b> that proportion of the electorate; winners under a Droop system were <b>elected</b> by that proportion of the electorate. </p> 
      <p> In an STV election in which there is only one seat to be filled (in other words an <a href="instant-runoff voting">Instant Run-off Voting</a> election) it is possible to use the Hare quota, which will simply be equal to 100% of votes cast. However, it is more efficient to use the Droop quota, which will be equal to an absolute majority of votes cast, meaning 50% plus one, and both quotas will achieve the same result. When voters have only one vote?the single non-transferable vote system?a candidate is sure to win if reaching the Droop quota. </p> 
      <p> In an STV election in which there are multiple winners the situation is slightly different, particularly with respect to the final seat. </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>The Hare quota is generally kinder to small parties than the Droop quota because they have a better chance to win the final seat. Elected winners with the Hare quota more closely represent the proportionality of the electorate, and this can mean more proportional results for small parties. But this comes at the expense of emphasising the principle of majority rule. In an <a href="open list">open list</a> election held under the Hare quota it is possible for a group of candidates supported by a majority of voters to receive only a minority of seats if those voters do not disperse their vote relatively evenly across all their supported candidates, see Scenario 1 below. In contrast, such an outcome will not happen in an election held under the Droop quota unless voters in the majority do not rank all their preferred candidates or not enough preferred candidates seek office.</li> 
       <li>The Droop quota is generally kinder to large parties because <i>they</i> have a better chance to win the final seat. This comes at the expense of emphasising the principle of proportional representation. In an election held under the Droop quota it is possible for a group of candidates to over-represent a proportion of voters even though a majority of the remaining voters support a minor party, see Scenario 2 below.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p> The Droop quota is today the most popular quota for STV elections - and almost universal for government STV elections - for two reasons <span class="unknown-node">{{Citation needed|...}}</span>. First, because it can more efficiently elect candidates in the each round of distribution of seats (whether STV or list PR) than is the case with the Hare quota. Second, because the possibility under the Hare quota that a group of candidates supported by a majority of voters to receive only a minority of seats is considered undemocratic <span class="unknown-node">{{Citation needed|...}}</span>. </p> 
      <p> Examples of the different outcomes between the Hare and the Droop quotas follow: </p>

    <div class="section"> 
     <h2>Scenario 1</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> An example with STV where the result under the Droop quota more closely reflects the support that voters have for a party, irrespective of the support they have for individuals within the party. </p> 
      <p> Imagine an election in which there are 5 seats to be filled. There are 6 candidates divided between two groups: Andrea, Carter and Brad are members of the Alpha party; Delilah, Scott and Jennifer are members of the Beta party. There are 120 voters and they vote as follows: </p>

      </table> 
      <p> It can be seen that supporters of the Alpha party all rank all three Alpha party candidates higher than any of the Beta party candidates (the final three preferences of the voters are not shown above because they will not affect the result of the election). Similarly, voters who support the Beta party all give their first three preferences to Beta party candidates. Overall, the Alpha party receives 63 votes out of a total of 120 votes. The Alpha party therefore has a majority of about 53%. The Beta party receives a 47% share of the vote. </p> 
      <p> Below the election results are shown first under the Hare quota and then under the Droop quota. It can be seen that under the Hare quota, despite receiving 53% of the vote, the Alpha party receives only a minority of seats. When the same election is conducted under the Droop quota, however, the Alpha party's majority is rewarded with a majority of seats. </p> 
      <p> Note that this issue can be avoided under the Hare quota if the <a href="Robson Rotation">Robson Rotation</a> is used to randomly order the party candidates. </p>

        <p> Team Doyle (Headed by Melbourne Lord Mayor <a href="Robert Doyle">Robert Doyle</a>) polled 37.5% of the vote. Under the Droop Quota they elected only three representatives and the remaining 7.5% were disenfranchised by being allocated to the wasted quota. </p> 
        <p> The Greens, who polled just 15.1%, elected two representatives with major teams increasing disproportionally the overall value of their representation. </p> 
        <p> Using the Hare Quota system Team Doyle's surplus votes would have been distributed and allocated to elect community based candidate Kevin Chamberlin. Every vote is counted and allocated to form part of a candidate's quota in equal proportion. </p> 
        <pre>
</pre> 
        <p> Opponents of the Droop quota argue that each vote should be counted equally and voters that form part of the wasted quota should not be disenfranchised. In a manual count the Droop quota allows for a result to be determined without having to fully distribute all votes. Under a Hare quota all votes would need to be distributed in order to obtain a result. With computerized counting systems the full distribution and the time required is no longer a limiting factor. </p> 
        <p> In the City of Melbourne scenario it is argued that Greens vote was inflated resulting in them increasing disproportionally their vote and electing two candidates as opposed to just one under a pure proportional Hare system. It is further argued that there is no merit justifying the exclusion of the Team Doyle surplus in determining the results of the proportional ballot. </p> 
        <p> Using the Droop Quota up to 25% of the total vote in a three member electorate can be ignored, locked into what is referred to as the redundant &quot;Wasted Quota&quot; with voters disenfranchised as a result. In the case of the nine member City of Melbourne Council election the wasted quota is just below 10%. </p>
