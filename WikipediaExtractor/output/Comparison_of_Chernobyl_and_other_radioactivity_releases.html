     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> Natural sources of radiation are very prevalent in the environment, and come from cosmic rays, food sources (bananas have a particular high source), radon gas, granite and other dense rocks, and others. The collective radiation background dose for natural sources in Europe is about 500,000 man Sieverts per year. The total dose from Chernobyl is estimated at 80,000 man sieverts, or roughly 1/6 as much.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> However, some individuals, particular in areas adjacent the reactor, received significantly higher doses. </p> 
      <p> Chernobyl's radiation was detectable across Western Europe. Average doses received ranged from 0.02 <a href="mrem">mrem</a> (<a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>) to 38 mrem (portions of <a href="Germany">Germany</a>).<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p>

    <div class="section"> 
     <h2>Chernobyl compared with an atomic bomb</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> Far fewer people died as an immediate result of the Chernobyl event than <a href="Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki">died of radiation at Hiroshima</a>, and the eventual total is also significantly less when including those 4,000 to ~41,000 predicted by the <a href="World Health Organization">WHO</a> and <a href="International Journal of Cancer">International Journal of Cancer</a> to die in the future.<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> Due to the differences in <a href="half-life">half-life</a> the different <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a> <a href="fission products">fission products</a> undergo <a href="exponential decay">exponential decay</a> at different rates. Hence the isotopic signature of an event where more than one radioisotope is involved will change with time. </p> 
      <p> Some comments have been made in which the radioactive release of the Chernobyl event is claimed to be 300<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> or 400<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> times that of the bomb dropped on <a href="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>. The work of SCOPE<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span><span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> suggests that the two events can not be simply compared with a number suggesting that <i>one was XX times larger than the other</i>. </p> 
      <p> The radioactivity released at Chernobyl tended to be more long lived than that released by a bomb detonation hence it is not possible to draw a simple comparison between the two events. Also, a dose of radiation spread over many years (as is the case with Chernobyl) is much less harmful than the same dose received over a short period. </p>

     <h2>Chernobyl compared with Tomsk-7</h2> 
     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> The release of radioactivity which occurred at <a href="Tomsk-7">Tomsk-7</a> (an industrial nuclear complex located in <a href="Seversk">Seversk</a> rather than the city of Tomsk) is another comparison with the Chernobyl release. During <a href="nuclear reprocessing">reprocessing</a> activities, some of the feed for the second cycle (medium active part) of the <a href="PUREX">PUREX</a> process escaped in an accident involving <a href="red oil">red oil</a>. According to the <a href="International Atomic Energy Agency">IAEA</a> it was estimated that the following isotopes were released from the reaction vessel:<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li> <sup>106</sup>Ru 7.9 TBq</li> 
       <li> <sup>103</sup>Ru 340 GBq</li> 
       <li> <sup>95</sup>Nb 11.2 TBq</li> 
       <li> <sup>95</sup>Zr 5.1 TBq</li> 
       <li> <i><sup>137</sup>Cs 505 GBq</i> (estimated from the IAEA data)</li> 
       <li> <sup>141</sup>Ce 370 GBq</li> 
       <li> <sup>144</sup>Ce 240 GBq</li> 
       <li> <sup>125</sup>Sb 100 GBq</li> 
       <li> <sup>239</sup>Pu 5.2 GBq</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p> It is important to note that the very short lived isotopes such as <sup>140</sup>Ba and <sup>131</sup>I were absent from this mixture, and the long lived <sup>137</sup>Cs was only at a small concentration. This is because it is not able to enter the <a href="tributyl phosphate">tributyl phosphate</a>/<a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a> organic phase used in the first <a href="liquid-liquid extraction">liquid-liquid extraction</a> cycle of the PUREX process. The second cycle is normally to clean up the <a href="uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> product. In the PUREX process some <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a>, <a href="technetium">technetium</a> and other elements are extracted by the tributyl phosphate. Due to the radiation induced degradation of tributyl phosphate the first cycle organic phase is always contaminated with <a href="ruthenium">ruthenium</a> (later extracted by dibutyl hydrogen phosphate). Because the very short lived radioisotopes <b>and</b> the relatively long lived caesium isotopes are either absent or in low concentrations the shape of the dose rate vs. time graph is different from Chernobyl both for short times and long times after the accident. </p> 
      <p> The size of the radioactive release at Tomsk-7 was much smaller, and while it caused moderate environmental contamination it did not cause any early <a href="death">deaths</a>. </p>

      <p> Three Mile Island-2 was an accident of a completely different type from Chernobyl. Chernobyl was a design flaw-caused power excursion causing a steam explosion resulting in a graphite fire, uncontained, which lofted radioactive smoke high into the atmosphere; TMI was a slow, undetected leak that lowered the water level around the nuclear fuel, resulting in over a third of it shattering when refilled rapidly with coolant. Unlike Chernobyl, TMI-2's reactor vessel did not fail and contained almost all of the radioactive material. <a href="Containment building">Containment</a> at TMI did not fail. A small quantity of radioactive gases from the leak were vented into the atmosphere through specially designed filters under operator control.

     <div class="section-body"> 
      <p> During the time between the start of the <a href="Manhattan project">Manhattan project</a> and the present day, a series of accidents have occurred in which nuclear criticality has played a central role. The criticality accidents may be divided into two classes. For more details see nuclear and radiation accidents. A good review of the topic was published in 2000, <a href="http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/accidents/la-13638.pdf">&quot;A Review of Criticality Accidents&quot;</a> by <a href="Los Alamos National Laboratory">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> (Report LA-13638), May 2000. Coverage includes United States, Russia, United Kingdom, and Japan.

       <h3>Process accidents</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> In the first class (process accidents) during the processing of <a href="fissile">fissile</a> material, accidents have occurred when a <a href="critical mass">critical mass</a> has been created by accident. For instance at <a href="Charlestown, Rhode Island">Charlestown</a>, <a href="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a>, United States on July 24, 1964 one death occurred and at <a href="Tokaimura">Tokaimura</a>, Japan, nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, on September 30, 1999<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> two deaths and one non fatal overexposure occurred as result of accidents where too much fissile matter was placed in a vessel. These accidents tend to lead to very high doses due to direct <a href="irradiation">irradiation</a> of the workers within the site, but due to the <a href="inverse square law">inverse square law</a> the dose suffered by members of the general public tends to be very small. Also very little environmental contamination normally occurs as a result of these accidents. A release of radioactivity occurred as a result of the Tokaimura event. The building in which the accident occurred was not designed as a containment building, yet it was able to retard the spread of radioactivity. Because the temperature rise in the nuclear reaction vessel was small, the majority of the <a href="fission products">fission products</a> remained in the vessel. </p>

       <h3>Reactor accidents</h3> 
       <div class="section-body"> 
        <p> In this type of accident a reactor or other critical assembly releases far more fission power than was expected, or it becomes critical at the wrong moment in time. The series of examples of such events include one in an experimental facility in <a href="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, on September 23, 1983 (one death)<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> and during the <a href="Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a> several people were irradiated (two, <a href="Harry K.

For instance at <a href="Sarov">Sarov</a> according to the <a href="IAEA">IAEA</a> report (2001)<span class="unknown-node">&lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt;</span> the radioactivity remained confined to within the <a href="actinide">actinide</a> metal objects which were part of the experimental system.
